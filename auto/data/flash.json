Six months later, while using his speed to repair Central City, Barry operates alone, being the hero and savior of the public and the local government; Cisco works in the police department alongside Joe, and Caitlin works at Mercury Labs. Barry evaluates a crime scene with a victim named Al Rothstein. At a ceremony, the Flash is attacked by Atom-Smasher, whose strength and size manipulation prove too much for Barry, but manages to force his mask off. Underneath the mask Atom-Smasher is revealed to look exactly like Rothstein. Barry is convinced by Joe and the others that he needs help in taking down certain metahumans and Rothstein is defeated by over absorbing radiation. As he dies, Rothstein tells Barry that he was sent to kill him by a person called Zoom. Barry receives a flash memory from Thawne's lawyer containing Thawne's confession to killing Nora. Henry is exonerated and released from prison, and leaves Central City so that Barry can focus on being the Flash. A man arrives at S.T.A.R.

In the new timeline, which Thawne dubs \"Flashpoint\", both of Barry's parents are alive; Joe has a poor relationship with Wally and Iris and is chronically in trouble at work; Cisco is a billionaire tech magnate; and Caitlin is a pediatric ophthalmologist. There is also a new Flash in Central City called Kid Flash struggling with his own nemesis, Edward Clariss, known as \"The Rival\". Barry begins losing his memories of the original timeline due to the new timeline becoming permanent. After discovering Kid Flash is Wally, Barry teams up with him and stops Clariss, but Wally is critically injured in the process. Realizing that the new timeline is worse for those closest to him, Barry is forced to let Thawne return to the past and kill Nora, resetting the timeline and restoring Barry's memories. Back in the present, Barry learns to his horror that the timeline did not reset exactly and Joe and Iris do not talk to each other anymore. Meanwhile, Clariss is confronted by a mysterious voice and finds the message \"Alchemy\" being scratched into his mirror by an invisible force.",

Although Barry and Iris try to get through to him, Savitar wrecks the lab and orders Caitlin to kill Cisco, but Gypsy saves him. Savitar and Killer Frost open a portal into the Speed Force. The Black Flash intervenes, but is frozen by Caitlin. Savitar then attempts to execute his plan. However, Cisco modified the Bazooka into a 'skeleton key' which frees Jay from the Speed Force prison. Barry, Wally and Jay engage Savitar, while Cisco, with Gyspy's help, convinces Caitlin to abandon Savitar. Barry phases through and destroys Savitar's armor before Savitar is erased from existence. As Team Flash mourns H.R., Caitlin decides not to use Julian's cure, leaving the team so she may find her own purpose. Later on, an energy storm appears over Central City, caused by the Speed Force prison being empty. Barry explains that he needs to atone for creating Flashpoint and enters the prison, entrusting Central City to Iris and the team.",
