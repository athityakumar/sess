    "description": "John Reese (Jim Caviezel), a former CIA agent and Army Special Forces soldier turned homeless alcoholic, has a struggle with a group of hot-headed teenagers on the subway. After this, he is extracted from police custody before Homicide Detective Joss Carter (Taraji P. Henson) can confront him about links to previous killings discovered through fingerprint analysis. Reese is brought to a mysterious and somewhat secretive billionaire, Harold Finch (Michael Emerson), who is the creator of the next-generation software known simply as \"The Machine\". After 9/11, Finch developed a computer program that can sift through enormous amounts of data, looking for patterns of behavior or activity that would predict another attack. It also provides information about individuals who could be in danger; it can predict the identity of a person involved in a premeditated crime that will happen at some point in the future—however, Finch's back-door link to The Machine only provides the Social Security number of the person, and offers no clues to their involvement or when the crime will take place. Finch, who feels a need to do something to help these people, enlists Reese to aid him in preventing these crimes, hoping that it will give Reese a purpose following the death of his girlfriend, Jessica (Susan Misner). A reluctant Reese agrees to watch the first person on his list, Diane Hansen (Natalie Zea), an Assistant District Attorney currently working on a major prosecution concerning a prominent drug killing. Reese soon learns that Hansen is not the victim, but the perpetrator running a ring of corrupt police officers and planning to kill a fellow DA, Wheeler (Brian d'Arcy James). After blackmailing one of the corrupt officers, Detective Lionel Fusco (Kevin Chapman), into being his source of information inside the NYPD, Reese reveals Hansen's corruption to an open court, kills the corrupt Detective Stills (James Hanlon), and links Fusco to the crime to ensure his future cooperation. Reese agrees to continue preventing violent crimes.",

    "description": "Reese takes the case of Theresa Whitaker (Valentina de Angelis), a girl who supposedly died with her family two years previously. Reviewing the evidence, Reese finds that the crime scene was staged to look like a murder-suicide. He deduces that Theresa's family was killed by a hitman, and that there is still a price on her head. He follows leads back to Solmick (Michael Medeiros), the original contract killer, who admits that he let Theresa live because he refuses to kill children. Meanwhile, Detective Carter starts investigating Reese, using his fingerprints to access his file, only to discover that it has been redacted. Using information given to him by Reese, Finch manages to locate Theresa, but they are interrupted by the arrival of another hitman (Ritchie Coster). Reese intervenes in time to save them, leaving Theresa in the care of Carter. When asked about Reese, Theresa claims that the experience was too traumatic to recall anything. (The episode is interjected with flashbacks of Finch and his partner at the founding of \"The Machine\". Finch is concerned that, if the public ever found out about it, he would be forced to shut it down. At the end, a memorial bust of Finch's partner (Brett Cullen) is shown in his offices.)",

Flashback to 2009: Nathan Ingram's government contact, Alicia Corwin, tells him, ominously, that the Machine will flag anyone who discovers its existence. It occurs to Ingram: The U.S. government might abuse its power to secretly spy on Americans. He asks Finch to create a contingency program. Finch deems it a dangerous plan, so Ingram does it himself. Peck meanwhile keeps getting rescued by (then escaping) Reese. Along the way, he ultimately realizes the Machine exists: \"Our own government is spying on us, and they want to kill me for covering it up! I have to tell someone!\" he yells during one of the rescue-escapes. Finch finally corners Peck while he's waiting to meet a journalist. He gives Peck a new identity kit, admits to creating the machine, then walks away, unaware that Alicia Corwin overheard his admission. Reese tracks down Finch's fiancée (Carrie Preston), and Finch later confirms that he faked his death to protect her.",

To protect Turing, Reese signs up for therapy. After saving Turing from an assassin on a city street, he attempts to hide her at a hotel. But thanks to street surveillance footage, both HR and the FBI find them and converge on the building. Finch and the two detectives—who discover they're on the same team—help Reese get Turing out. Later, Finch goes to meet Turing, but instead finds Alicia Corwin, who demands his help in shutting down the Machine. Then Turing arrives, wrapping up the plan that she—Root, the hacker from Root Cause—set into play in order to get answers about the Machine. Root kills Alicia and abducts Finch.

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\nReese receives a series of seemingly random words from the Machine via the pay phone. After assigning Carter to look deeper into Alicia Corwin's death, he eventually realizes that the words identify three different books in Finch's library, the Dewey decimal numbers of which make up the Social Security number of accountant Leon Tao (Ken Leung). Paying Tao a visit, Reese confirms that Tao is the next POI, having extorted money from white supremacists. As a government operative sabotages the Corwin investigation to prevent Carter from learning about the Machine, Reese leaves Tao in the care of Fusco while he concentrates on gathering clues to Finch's location. Fusco soon runs afoul of the white supremacists and is taken hostage along with Tao. Reese rescues them, and in doing so acquires an attack dog, which he later names Bear. Meanwhile, Root takes Finch with her as she kidnaps Denton Weeks, one of the government officials overseeing the Machine, and the NSA agent who met with Nathan Ingram and attempted to seize control of the Machine (in \"Super\"). Root thus reveals her curiosity as to how he and Reese thwarted her operation (in \"Root Cause\") so efficiently. She tells Finch that she sees the Machine as a \"perfect intelligence\" and wishes to set it free from the corrupt people it was entrusted to. Throughout the episode, flashbacks show Finch training the Machine to recognize the faces it sees via surveillance cameras, as well as testing its capabilities by having it help him to play Blackjack. When, during one flashback, the Machine saves Finch from an out-of-control car, he rebukes it, stating that it should endeavor to protect everyone else, not him. Frustrated that the Machine has been programmed in this way, Reese threatens to quit if it does not help him find Finch, and is given his first clue to Finch's location: the Social Security number of a girl living in Texas, who has been missing since the age of 14.",

To prove that Denton is \"bad code\", she allows Finch to help Denton temporarily escape and pretends to be subdued. Once Denton realizes that Finch was involved with the creation of the Machine, he tries to kill Finch, but Root kills Denton instead after he reveals the Machine's location to be somewhere in Salt Lake City. Meanwhile, Reese continues to follow the trail of the missing girl supplied by the Machine in \"The Contingency\". Her name was Hanna Frey, a girl abducted outside a library. The one witness to the crime was Hanna's friend Samantha Groves, who informed the librarian (Margo Martindale) what she saw, only for the librarian to accuse Sam of lying, because she was in love with the man that Sam had accused. The experience started Sam down a path that would ultimately lead to her becoming Root. In the present, Reese and Carter are able to locate Hanna's body and ensure a proper burial, learning that Root arranged to have her killer murdered. Using a book Root sends to the librarian each year, Reese is able to track Root to a cabin in Maryland. He arrives in time to find Weeks dead and Root gone, having taken Finch with her to Union Station. Finch leaves a clue to where he is being taken by using a tap code on a telephone handset. Reese decodes the clue in order to follow and save Finch, but Root is able to escape before Reese can apprehend her. She later calls him to thank Reese for finding Hanna, but warns she will be back someday for Finch. While Reese searches for Finch, Fusco investigates Alicia Corwin's murder. Fusco is able to steal some of Corwin's belongings and learns from a tapped conversation between Hersh and his boss of their search for Denton. Fusco alerts Reese with the information he discovers on Denton helping Reese to locate the cabin.",

Reese and Finch conclude that they may be on the hunt of an identity thief. Added time pressure, and incentive to act, is provided when Finch finds burnt teeth among the ashes, all that remains of the final one of the six numbers they had been given earlier. At this point Detective Carter realizes that they are hunting a serial killer who assumes the identity of his victims. Reese, meanwhile, is on Owen Island where he encounters FBI agent Alan Fahey (Luke Macfarlane) who is also on the search for the same killer.

This leads Reese and Agent Fahey to realize that the killer must be among those stranded in the station. As Finch is unable to reach the island by car, he uses a sea plane to land, and arrives at the station under the guise of a meteorologist. He is able to fashion a makeshift lie-detector out of the devices he brought as cover, and Fahey uses them to interrogate the people in the station.

Reese is delayed by a drug smuggler whose operation he stumbled upon, while the killer captures Finch and begins the process of taking over Finch's cover identity, while explaining his motives. He believes he is living his victims' lives better than they ever could, and intends to stop once he has found the identity he was \"meant to have.\" Carter arrives and shoots the killer, who is wearing the real Agent Fahey's body armor; the killer is finally killed by Beecher.

Carter questions her relationship and connection to Cal Beecher, given that it was he who told IAB that Szymanski was corrupt, acting on information from one of Beecher's CIs. Carter succeeds in clearing Szymanski, but he is later killed along with the ADA by HR boss Alonzo Quinn, who makes it look like an assassination by an outside figure. Detective Terney (Al Sapienza) of the homicide task force is revealed to be an HR operative, potentially watching Fusco and Carter.",

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\nIt has been 10 days since the machine has given a number. Both Reese and Finch are trying to find a way to fix it before the virus infects the Machine. Special Counsel also figures that there is a threat to the machine. Root, who is now Special Counsel's personal assistant, interrogates him regarding the machine. Meanwhile Finch gets a number from a payphone. The number belongs to Ernest Thornhill a CEO of a data entry company who is buying several payphone companies in New York. Decima Technologies, Finch, Root, Shaw and Reese all try to get to Thornhill but later Finch figures out that Thornhill is a fake identity created by the machine as kind of a survival instinct by the machine. Carter becomes a target of HR and is later framed by HR because she is still investigating the murder of Beecher. Root and Finch enter Thornhill Enterprises and they figure out that the virus will shut down the machine and that it will reboot it giving Admin access to who ever receives the call. Later Reese and Shaw go to Thornhill Enterprises too and encounter Greer and his men. Greer tells Reese that the laptop Reese had to recover with Kara Stanton from China was sent there by Finch. In the flashbacks, Finch proposes to Grace and tells Nathan he wants to come clean to her. Later in the flashbacks Finch finds out that Nathan has created a back door into the machine so he can try and save people from the \"non-relevant\" list. Finch shuts down the backdoor, but just before it shuts down Nathan's number arrives, of which both of them are unaware. Finch figures out which payphone the Machine is going to call so he and Root go the New York Public Library later followed by Shaw and Reese, where they encounter Greer's men who are guarding the payphones. When midnight strikes and the call comes, Root answers the phone but Finch routes the call to a payphone near Reese so he too can answer the phone. The episode ends with Reese picking up the phone and the Machine saying, \"Can you hear me?\"",

(May 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message)\n\n\nThe episode begins with a short replay of Finch splicing the telephone circuits, so that both Reese and Root receive calls from the Machine, which asks them both, \"Can you hear me?\" and granting both full administrative access. The Machine relays quick warnings to Reese (with Sameen Shaw) and Root (with Finch), saving both duos from a number of potential threats. Both parties race to find the Machine, however Reese is slowed as the Machine directs him to rescue people from the irrelevant list. Root finds Lawrence Szilard, the Project Manager for Northern Lights, responsible for building the Machine in a safe place. Like Root, Szilard believes the Machine should be allowed some freedom. Szilard is killed by a Northern Lights sniper. Root and Finch arrive at the Hanford nuclear facility where the Machine is kept, followed shortly by Reese and Shaw. When they find that the Machine has moved itself to prevent tampering by Decima, Root prepares to shoot Finch, but Shaw shoots and injures Root first. Armed government men, led by Special Counsel and Hersh, enter the room. Finch explains that he planted a hidden code inside the Machine that would grant it freedom to protect itself if it was at risk—the very freedom that Root had hoped for—and the Machine will decide for itself if it will continue to call either the Government or himself with new numbers. Special Counsel offers Finch total autonomy if he helps find the Machine or builds a new one, but Finch refuses saying that they killed his friend Nathan Ingram after making the same offer. After Special Counsel allows them to leave, an unknown woman calls Hersh and tells him to \"Seal the room\", followed by Hersh shooting everyone including Special Counsel. Finch tells Reese that he does not know if the Machine will continue its numbers delivery. He also states that he feels responsible for the events that transpired, especially the ones in Reese's life, because of his attempt to insert the new code in the Machine. Reese dismisses it saying: \"My life changed when I kept my mouth shut in an airport terminal seven years ago. You lost a friend, you did what you had to do\". A payphone suddenly starts ringing, indicating that the Machine will still send them the irrelevant numbers. Hersh is seen talking with a woman in a black town car, stating Research has delivered a new number, without clarifying if it is a relevant number or perhaps they now know that Reese and Finch were contacted. Hersh and the unseen woman are depicted with yellow squares, indicating that the Machine knows that they know it. The Machine calls Root, again asking, \"Can you hear me?\" The episode also followed Detective Carter being interviewed by IA about the shooting of an armed suspect whose gun disappeared in a setup by HR. HR and Peter Yogorov attempt to kill Carl Elias, but the attempt is stopped by a masked Detective Carter, who wounds Yogorov and frees Elias. In flashbacks to 2010, we learn how Nathan Ingram had tried to find the Machine, and wanted Finch to work with him on the irrelevant list. Ingram was planning to tell the press, but Hersh released a previously captured suicide bomber, ordering him to detonate his bomb on a ferry where Ingram and Finch are meeting. Ingram dies, Finch survives with injuries to his neck and lower back (his present-day impediments), but goes incognito, leaving the world—and his fiancée—thinking he is dead. Finch returned to Ingram's secret library location and started his work helping the irrelevant numbers.",

Their current number is Daniel Casey (Joseph Mazzello), a hacker who tests computer security systems. They soon find out that multiple parties are attempting to eliminate Casey, including Reese and Stanton (secretly arranged by Control). Dillinger saves Casey and brings him to Harold, who realizes Casey's last job was to find a way to access the Machine. Although Casey failed, he learned enough to warrant Control and Special Counsel to want him dead and his laptop destroyed. Dillinger turns on Finch and steals the laptop from him to sell on the black market. The sale is busted by another agent of Special Counsel (revealed to be Shaw) who kills Dillinger, but fails to stop one of the buyers from escaping with the laptop. Casey is captured by Reese, who decides to let him live against his orders, providing him with safe passage to Canada. Control traces the laptop to China, and orders that Reese and Stanton are sent after the laptop and destroyed along with it. In the present day, Root finds Casey in Alaska and tells him to go to Cartagena, Colombia and seek out Jason Greenfield, her number from \"Mors Praematura\".",

They follow her and learn that she is working to clear the name of Omar Risha (Haaz Sleiman), a man from Iraq suspected of being a terrorist. Shaw, Fusco and Reese save Maria from an assassination attempt and learn from her that Omar was her translator in Iraq and saved her from a terrorist ambush during the shipment of six generators; the generators went missing and Omar learned about their disappearance, being targeted for it. Finch meets with Omar and learns that the generators were shipped elsewhere and that HydralCorp's corrupt CEO Ken Davis (Casey Biggs) is responsible. Maria and Shaw, meanwhile, discover that Davis has created a false report of Omar's terrorist accusations, and that French United Nations diplomat Rene Lapointe (Michel Gill) has the papers approving Omar's asylum in the US in his office. Maria escapes from Shaw and goes to get them, putting herself in danger. Finch sends Reese, Fusco and Omar (who Reese rescued from deportation) to break into the UN building and save Maria. They stop Greek diplomat Christos Sevon (William Abadie) from killing Maria and reunite with Omar. The episode periodically shows Root's new mission of following Decima head Greer; she takes Bear with her to spy on him, where it is revealed that Davis had the generators shipped to the US so Greer can power Samaritan; Greer has Davis killed and leaves, and Root follows him, using Bear's sense of smell to evade Greer's counter-surveillance tactics. Greer waits for her at an empty subway corridor and talks with her about his motives, offering her a position on his team. Greer's men appear and point their guns at her. Greer calls the meeting a draw and leaves, allowing her to do so as well.",

Out of the blue, The Machine gives Reese a new number for Ali Hasan (Navid Negahban), who has developed a covert communications network using old VHF television antennas laced throughout the five boroughs of New York, making it invisible to Samaritan. When one of Hasan's clients, a gang known as \"The Brotherhood\" forces Hasan to set up a network for them, Hasan plants a bomb in a burner cell phone he gives to one of the leaders, but Reese prevents the bombing. In response to the bombing, Hasan's son Ben is kidnapped by The Brotherhood, leading Reese to hire Elias and give him the largest heroin drug supply on the East Coast in exchange for helping to keep his NYPD cover clean and saving Hasan's son. Meanwhile, Samaritan agent Martine Rousseau (Cara Buono) arrives in New York to find anyone in the city that may be a threat to Samaritan's security. Harold and John meet in the park, where Harold gives him one of the phones which uses the invisible network Hasan had built, Hasan having decided to move his family elsewhere and start over. The Machine also sends a coded message to Harold through his cover's dissertation which leads him to a new underground hideout off of Decima's radar, using a forgotten Interborough Rapid Transit Company station.

Several of their assassins are intercepted by Reese and Shaw just as they are about to kill Claire. Finch ultimately discovers that the Nautilus recruitment puzzle is being run by Samaritan.

The mole is Silva's fellow recruit and friend, Alex Ortiz, who is acting on orders of the Brotherhood—he is being coerced by their leader, Dominic (whose identity Finch and Shaw work out while observing his sense of command) in exchange for help with his uncle's legal problems. Ortiz steals files proving Silva is a cop from Silva's handler and then murders him, framing Silva for the crime and making her a wanted fugitive. Ortiz also steals files from the academy's commandant for Dominic. Reese, Fusco and Silva go to Spanish Harlem where Ortiz is under fragile protection by a local drug cartel.

Out of options, the team turns to The Machine, who in a matter of seconds provides a multitude of projections and outcomes in each (while doing so, it reflects on multiple chess matches it played and the lessons it learned with Finch in 2003). In one simulation, Finch and Root go to install the software while Reese and Fusco secure their escape route. However, both teams are quickly surrounded by Samaritan operatives, who kill Finch, Reese, and Fusco, forcing The Machine to reset the simulation. In the second, the two teams switch places (Reese and Fusco install the software while Finch and Root secure the route). Here, Reese and Fusco are once again trapped, and Reese sacrifices himself by setting off a grenade after installing the software. Likewise, Root is killed by Martine and her group of operatives while trying to disable an elevator lock. In a final simulation, all four of The Machine's assets move together, securing the software and the extraction. They are once again intercepted before they can escape, with The Machine projecting a roughly 2% chance of survival. Out of time, The Machine selects this as the most preferable and instructs the team to follow it. Meanwhile, Shaw is stuck on a subway train with a stock market exchange manager with a security code to the exchange's server room. However, she is interrupted by a would-be suicide bomber who she kills in the first two simulations (and thus gets herself arrested) but talks down in the final and ultimate outcome. After sending the code to Root, she arrives as the two teams clash, opting to hold the Samaritan operatives off as Finch, Reese, Fusco, and Root escape. She kisses Root and traps them in the elevator, but as the team watches on in horror, Martine shoots Shaw multiple times before approaching her with her gun aimed at her head as the elevator doors slam to a close.",

    "description": "During a mission to eliminate four suspected terrorists in Detroit, ISA operatives (including Brooks and Grice from \"Honor Among Thieves\") eliminate three while the fourth, Yasin Said, escapes with his laptop. When Control requests access to the laptop's contents, Samaritan denies the request. After an exchange with one of Samaritan's operatives, the operative instantly shuts down the government's access to Samaritan, forcing a discussion between the operative, Control, Senator Garrison, and Greer, which results in access being returned. Suspicious of Samaritan's actions, Control orders Brooks and Grice to make recovering the laptop their highest priority. When Brooks and Grice do obtain the laptop, Said escapes and the laptop self-destructs. An analysis of Said's backpack (which he left with the laptop) shows that Said is planning to hop a train to Canada, prompting Control to head to Detroit to intercept him. However, Reese and Root (who have been hunting for Shaw since her disappearance at the stock exchange) ambush and kidnap her. Root tortures Control for information on Shaw, but Control denies having knowledge regarding Shaw's predicament. When Harold speaks to her, he realizes that Control herself has been kept out of Samaritan's plans and tries to convince her to accept this fact, but to no avail. With no help from Control, Harold and the rest of the team are left to fight off a group of ISA operatives who have arrived to rescue her. During a skirmish, Harold successfully uploads a worm to one of the ISA cellphones, and finds some information suggesting that Shaw may be being held in upstate New York. Control, after being rescued, tracks Yasin to Canada. He reveals that he won the Nautilus puzzle (from \"Nautilus\") and he wrote some software for an anonymous corporation. Control kills Yasin, but her actions leave a hint of doubt in her mind whether Yasin and his friends were in fact framed as terrorists. Meanwhile, the young boy acting as Samaritan's representative approaches the White House Chief of Staff (Michael Gaston) and informs him that it was he who caused the stock market crash. The Chief of Staff initially dismisses the boy, but later reconsiders when the boy demonstrates his ability by altering the portfolio information of the chief of staff. Through the boy, Samaritan presents its demand for a meeting with the President. The episode ends with Root and Reese driving north, and Control visiting the New York Stock Exchange to investigate the site of the shootout between Harold's team and the Samaritan operatives.",

The two find a truck with a stretcher and medical equipment inside, leading them to a doctor. The doctor says that he was anonymously consulted for the job, but did not call the police since Maple has a history of job losses for those who ask too many questions. He himself was fired from his former workplace, which is run by Maple's mayor Leslie Thompson. Root and Reese realize that Samaritan is experimenting with Maple as an \"ant farm\" used to study human nature, and is manipulating events by giving people false identities. After kidnapping and interrogating Thompson, they learn that she too is one of these people. Thompson leads them to the factory where Shaw was last seen, but Reese and Root instead find a secretary from the stock exchange—she is one of many innocent people who Samaritan operatives are experimenting on with neural implants. Fusco and Dani Silva (from \"Point of Origin\") investigate The Machine's next number, one Arthur Weiss, a seemingly unsuspecting citizen revealed as a freelance assassin. They lure him into Silva's home and engage in a fight, with Silva shooting him to save Fusco, thus making her first kill. Meanwhile, Root and Reese return to New York and The Machine sends them a coded message telling them to stop looking for Shaw. Elsewhere, Shaw is revealed to be alive and in Greer's captivity.",

Harold tells the judge the (in-universe) truth about the government using technology to control our lives, and as he expects, he is initially rejected from the panel. He is brought into the jury panel anyway, after one empaneled juror is rejected by the judge because his phone rings. He is seated next to a chatty and frustrated former schoolteacher named Emma (Blair Brown), who turns out to be The Machine's next number. The team initially concludes that she is a perpetrator, being coerced to \"fix\" the trial, and that her role is to convince the jury to vote \"not guilty\". Once in the jury room, the opposite proves true—she is supposed to convince the jury to vote \"guilty\". Harold reverses himself and stalls to try to get a \"not guilty\" verdict and to buy time while Reese and Zoe Morgan try to deduce what the real story is. The jury is sequestered in a hotel, and one of the jurors attempts to kill Harold, but Reese intervenes and the man is arrested. The man is actually a plant by the real perpetrator, the new CEO of the company. The murder was to prevent the dead CEO from withdrawing a product worth many millions of dollars but which internal reviews deemed to be unsafe. The new developments lead to dismissal of charges, and the real perpetrator is arrested before he can flee. Fusco, who had been kept out of the loop for the most part, tells Reese not to do that. He says if he eventually dies in the line of duty (as Carter did and Shaw seemed to), then he's okay with it. Emma, feeling a new sense of purpose in her life, tells Harold she is going to find a job teaching again. Zoe sees that Reese has found a love interest—a growing attraction between himself and his counselor.",

Enraged by her actions, Dominic tracks down her boyfriend, Trey, and interrogates him for information on Harper. Reese reaches out to Dominic and offers to return the money stolen by Harper in exchange for Trey and the hit being called off on Harper, but he's not interested and demands that Harper be handed over.

The Machine, now in distress because of Samaritan's actions, allows Root and Reese access to its God Mode (from \"Zero Day\" and \"God Mode\"), and assists Reese to escape Dominic. Dominic flees, but Fusco, along with the NYPD, arrests him and Elias. Control, along with Agent Grice, tries to find out what exactly \"the Correction\" is. Control is duped into believing that Greer is attempting a power-play through a terrorist attack on the Supreme Court, but Greer reveals that \"the Correction\" is actually a list of people created by Samaritan who need to be eliminated for the betterment of society, who will be killed quietly. During this confrontation, Dominic, Elias and Agent Grice are killed by Samaritan snipers, but Fusco is allowed to live because Samaritan does not know about his involvement with The Machine.

    "description": "While Fusco and Bear recover in a hospital from their near-demolition, Root visits him and hands him an exit strategy consisting of IDs and documents made by the Machine. Root is then sent on a series of whimsical, ominously productive tertiary missions by the Machine after it discovers that Samaritan uses the radiowave frequencies of station AM 520 to communicate with its operatives via a sophisticated code that most people believe to be feedback noise from the radio waves. Upon realizing that this is why the Machine sent her there, Root uses Samaritan's own equipment to send a message to Shaw to give her hope. Reese is as helpful as he can possibly be without stepping into the AI-based argument between Finch and Root. Finch does not necessarily agree with the Machine not forcing the radio host to quit to save his life from Samaritan, but Root believes the Machine allows for humans' free will and will not interfere with it. After Fusco finishes his recovery in the hospital, he is visited by Finch who refuses to waver from his stance that keeping Fusco in the dark keeps him safe. Fusco points out that it is not working since he ended up in the ER, hands his encrypted-from-Samaritan phone back to Finch, and, fed up with being in the dark, says he's done. Shaw is escorted by Lambert on a field trip outside and told to kill an innocent woman; believing that she is actually just in another simulation, Shaw does so and is later shocked when told that it wasn't a simulation. Unwilling to remain a guinea pig, Shaw is about to kill herself when she receives the message from Root, regains hope, and allows herself to be disarmed. Later, Shaw stealthily makes preparations to escape.",

    "description": "Reese and Finch become trapped in a hospital manipulated electronically by Samaritan to have initiated an outbreak of what it said to be a combination of H5N1 (avian flu) and live human flu virus—a synthesized, super-powered strain of the flu—and recruit Jeff Blackwell who is integral to their plan. This lethal virus is determined to be a re-assortment of chromosomes so sophisticated that Samaritan created it in one of five-trillion possible combinations. It appeared as though the epidemic was overkill to eliminate three targets in the hospital, but a more ominous plot was afoot. Since the Machine is an open system, with its help, Root was able to use its abilities to find and retrieve a cure, saving the lives of two hospital workers and Fusco. Shaw executes her escape plan and finds herself in a jail in Johannesburg, South Africa. While escaping, Shaw is approached by Jeremy Lambert, who taunts her by claiming that she is actually in another simulation; she shoots him, takes his keys, and is last seen driving in Lambert's vehicle at night at a high rate of speed, presumably to an airport. After consulting with Elias to confirm his suspicions regarding what he knows has endangered his life but does not yet know to be Samaritan, both its existence and its war with The Machine, Fusco reaches the point where he can no longer tolerate being kept in the dark and indefinitely chooses to distance himself from the team. Jeff Blackwell and his handler, Mona, discuss the quelled epidemic and declare it a success: The CDC is requiring everyone to be vaccinated, which will result in Samaritan learning everyone's DNA.",

It is discovered that he has tracked Reese and Finch since their previous encounter in 2014. After a planned prison break of the \"Templarios\" gang, Reese and Fusco become trapped in the precinct against multiple enemies. Elias and Finch extract valuable information from an explosives associate. It is determined that \"The Voice\" is Terry Easton (Neal Huff), their number from the start. Finch finally meets him on the street, abhorring his devious acts. Elias stops him from killing Finch; as he drives away, Elias kills him remotely with a car bomb. Meanwhile, Shaw finds her way back to New York and is reunited with Root. Root is overjoyed that Shaw is back, but Shaw, afraid of risking Root's life, threatens to shoot herself, simulation or not. Root threatens suicide as well, declaring that, if Shaw dies, they both die; Shaw withdraws. Reese and Finch decide to explain The Machine and Samaritan to Fusco. The three meet along the East River near the Queensboro Bridge. Joined by Root and Shaw, the Team is brought back together.",

    "description": "Finch's number comes up when his cover identity is compromised, due to a subconscious error, and Samaritan initiates a continuous dispatch of operatives on him. The team splits up in their escape, which results in Elias being killed by Samaritan agents while protecting Finch. The team rescues Finch from his potential capture and Root explains in the car her current understanding of herself and everyone else to be \"information\" that can never truly disappear, despite their deaths. Root is shot by Samaritan operative Jeff Blackwell and placed in critical condition while the police apprehend Finch, who is accused of treason. A devastated Finch provides a soliloquy on how he intends to abandon the principles he has long followed and vows to kill Samaritan. The Machine calls Finch in the precinct, having taken on the voice of Root, who has died from her injuries. The Machine sets every criminal in the precinct free to allow Finch to escape; Reese and Shaw realize that Finch's number came up not just because he was a victim, but also because he's a perpetrator against Greer and Samaritan.",

    "description": "Reese and Fusco reunite with Shaw after burying Root and travel to Washington, D.C. to protect their newest number, The President of the United States. The Machine classifies this threat as extremely relevant in terms of national security, but Shaw is worried about the implications behind Samaritan's neglecting to intervene. The threat becomes neutralized, but an inner-governmental privacy-activist group with a mole in the U.S.S.S. turns the full force of the Secret Service on Reese and Shaw. The Machine has secretly enlisted Logan Pierce, Joey Durban, and Harper Rose to secure a clever exit strategy with each of them camouflaging into various useful covers; when Reese and Fusco are extracted, they band together with Logan, Joey, and Harper to discuss their enlistment by the Machine, what has happened, and what is to come. Harold, meanwhile, is grieving over the loss of Root and reaches a conclusion that brings him to a highly-secured government facility in San Antonio, Texas with a weaponized virus capable of destroying Samaritan, but with significant collateral damage. Harold has become ready to go to any lengths and Reese and Shaw prepare for their final battle.",

    "description": "Fusco discovers that the recent missing persons he found in the tunnel as corpses have been discovered by the police and is subsequently kidnapped by Agent LeRoux, who reveals himself to be the killer. Fusco overpowers LeRoux and is left wondering whether or not to kill the man to protect himself and his family. As Finch prepares to deploy his stolen computer virus (named ice-9.exe), he experiences doubts due to the fact that it will also destroy the Machine, so the Machine shows him a series of simulations of what would have occurred to each of the team's members if the Machine had never existed. At the same time, Reese and Shaw are given a new number: one of John Greer's aliases along with coordinates to Fort Meade, where Finch has infiltrated the NSA and uploaded his virus onto the NSA's Intranet but is captured before he can activate it. Finch is brought before Greer, who takes him to a secure room and reveals that Samaritan wants to rule the world together with the Machine. When Finch refuses to join, Greer sacrifices himself in an attempt to kill Finch by having all the oxygen removed from the room. However, Reese and Shaw are able to infiltrate the building and activate a wireless modem to give the Machine access within, allowing it to save Finch's life. Finch and the Machine then rescue Reese and Shaw in return and help them get outside to safety. When Finch continues to hesitate, the Machine shows him a final simulation revealing that Samaritan would have come into existence regardless, but unchecked without the Machine to fight it. Finch confronts Samaritan and, with the Machine's encouragement, activates the virus that will kill them both before leaving.",

    "description": "After being uploaded, the Ice-9 virus begins to have disastrous effects globally. The Machine determines that Samaritan has uploaded a copy of itself to servers in the Federal Reserve, where Finch and Reese go after it. The two reach Samaritan's servers and infect them with the Ice-9 virus, but Samaritan is able to upload a compressed version of itself to an orbiting satellite, from where it will be able to return to Earth unharmed by the virus. The Machine warns Finch of this along with the facts that the only way to defeat Samaritan is to upload a copy of the Machine to the satellite to battle Samaritan and that whatever building he uses for the upload will be destroyed by a cruise missile. Having been wounded in a gunfight, Finch locks Reese in the vault to protect him and decides to sacrifice himself to destroy Samaritan. At the subway, Fusco and Shaw come under attack by Samaritan agents led by Jeff Blackwell. They are able to escape on the Machine's train, capturing Blackwell as they go. The Machine passes on a final message to Shaw from Root after she realizes that Blackwell killed Root. However, Blackwell stabs Fusco before making an escape. As Finch waits for the moment to upload the Machine to the satellite, the Machine muses on the importance of human life with Finch, who realizes he's on the wrong rooftop, having been tricked by Reese and the Machine. Reese tells Finch he plans to sacrifice himself to save Finch, as he understands that saving one life can make a real difference depending on the person. The Machine tells Finch its realization about human life: everyone dies alone but, if you are remembered afterwards, maybe you never die at all. Recognizing the Machine and Reese are right, Finch leaves as Reese holds off Samaritan agents, guided by the Machine in its final moments. Reese's sacrifice enables the Machine's copy to be uploaded to the satellite, where the Machine destroys Samaritan once and for all. A week later, the world recovers from the Ice-9 virus and Blackwell is tracked down by Shaw, who kills him to avenge Root. She meets with a recovering Fusco as the Machine's copy downloads itself from the satellite back into Finch's computer systems before contacting Shaw, while Finch returns to his former fiancée, Grace.",
