                                                                        <div class="ui message"><p>This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise.  <br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The episode begins the process of interweaving action happening in multiple separate locations within and around the fictional continent of Westeros. Most of the action takes place in and around Winterfell where Lord Eddard Stark is the feudal overlord of the northern reaches of the kingdom. Outside of Westeros is a land across the Narrow Sea where the two surviving members of House Targaryen, previous rulers of Westeros, live in exile.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>The episode opens with three rangers of the Night's Watch – Ser Waymar Royce, Will and Gared – scouting beyond the Wall, a massive barrier of ice at the north end of the kingdom. After finding the mutilated corpses of some wildlings , the rangers are confronted by White Walkers  and undead wildlings. Two of the rangers are killed by the White Walkers, while the third, Will, is for some reason left alive. Fearing for his life, Will deserts the Night's Watch, going South, without returning to the Wall.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Queen Cersei, and her twin brother, Jaime Lannister, are watching as the dead body of Jon Arryn, The Hand of The King is tended to by the Silent Sisters. They discuss whether he revealed any dangerous information regarding the two of them to anyone before his death. Jaime assures his sister that if Arryn had spoken to anyone, they would already have been executed.<br><br>In the North<br><br>After the opening sequence, the Starks of Winterfell are introduced, including Lord Eddard "Ned" Stark, his wife, Lady Catelyn "Cat" Stark and his five children: their heir Robb, their elder daughter Sansa, younger daughter Arya, ten-year-old son Bran and youngest son, Rickon. Also introduced are Ned's illegitimate son Jon Snow and ward Theon Greyjoy, who, like Robb, are older teenagers.<br><br>Ned is informed that a deserter of the Night's Watch, Will, has been captured. Members of the Night's Watch are sworn never to desert their posts, upon penalty of death. Ned takes his sons to witness Will's execution. Will reports repeatedly that he saw White Walkers, but nobody believes him. The young man faces death bravely, admitting that he "should have gone back to the Wall and warned them". Ned himself passes sentence and beheads him. When Bran asks his father about the ranger's talk of White Walkers, Ned dismisses it as a madman's ravings, insisting that the Walkers have been considered extinct for thousands of years.<br><br>Upon their return, the Starks find a dead stag, sigil  of House Baratheon. A bit farther they find a dead dire wolf and her surviving pups. Noting that the dire wolf is the sigil of the Stark family and there are as many pups as the Stark children , they take the pups in as companions.<br><br>Back at Winterfell, Catelyn informs her husband of a letter announcing the death of Lord Arryn, Eddard's old friend and Catelyn's brother-in-law. An additional message reports that the king himself is coming to Winterfell. Winterfell receives the royal court, including King Robert Baratheon; his wife Queen Cersei; their three children: the heir Prince Joffrey, Princess Myrcella and the youngest Prince Tommen; as well as Cersei's twin brother, Jaime Lannister, a member of the Kingsguard; and their younger brother, Tyrion Lannister, a dwarf known as "The Imp". As Robert pays his respects to Lyanna Stark, his late fiancée and Ned's sister, Robert confides to his old friend that he doesn't trust anyone around him. He decides to name Ned as the new Hand of the King, and to solidify the alliance between the two families, he suggests that Ned's daughter, Sansa, be betrothed to his son, Joffrey.<br><br>At night, Catelyn receives a troubling message from her sister, Lord Arryn's widow. She suspects her husband Jon was murdered by the king's in-laws, the powerful Lannisters. Ned, who at first was reluctant to accept the position of Hand of the King, does so in order to protect his old friend. Bran, who enjoys climbing the walls of Winterfell, climbs an abandoned tower where he stumbles on Queen Cersei and Jaime having sex. To keep the incestuous relationship a secret, Jaime shoves Bran out of the high window.<br><br>In Pentos<br><br>Exiled prince Viserys Targaryen plots to overthrow King Robert and reclaim his father's throne. To this end, he brokers a marriage between his sister Daenerys and a powerful warlord Khal Drogo, leader of a nomadic horde of Dothraki.<br><br>Daenerys voices her fear of the barbarian lord, but her brother tells her to marry him. During the wedding ceremony, Daenerys is given two wedding gifts. The first is a collection of books from the Seven Kingdoms, given by Ser Jorah Mormont, an exiled knight loyal to the Targaryens. The second gift is a chest containing three petrified dragon eggs, given by Magister Illyrio Mopatis, the man who helped arrange the marriage.</p></div></div>

                                                                        <div class="ui message"><p>In the Dothraki Sea<br><br>On their way to Vaes Dothrak with Drogo's khalasar, Jorah Mormont reveals to Viserys that he was exiled for selling poachers to slavers. Viserys assures Jorah that he would not have been punished if Viserys had been the king and demonstrates impatience for Drogo to lend Viserys his army.<br><br>Daenerys has difficulty adjusting to her new marriage and the nomadic lifestyle of her adopted people. Her only comfort is the three petrified dragon eggs given to her by Illyrio. She is visibly distraught and in pain during intimate relations with the Khal. In order to feel more in control of her marital life, she asks one of her handmaidens, former courtesan Doreah, to teach her how to please her new husband.<br><br>In the North<br><br>Bran has been in a coma for more than a month since being thrown from the tower by Jaime Lannister. After slapping his nephew Prince Joffrey for refusing to give his condolences to the Starks, Tyrion Lannister informs his siblings that despite Bran's fall, the boy will survive, much to the dismay of the incestuous Lannister twins.<br><br>It is time for farewells, with the Stark family having to split apart. Ned's two daughters journey with their father to the capital. Jon Snow journeys to join his uncle Benjen as a man of the Night's Watch at the Wall. Tyrion, who wants to see the "edge of the world", accompanies them. Before leaving, Jon gives a sword to his sister Arya as a present. Lady Catelyn Stark is devastated by her husband's imminent departure and has stood vigil beside her son Bran since his fall. Having always deeply resented Jon, Catelyn asks him to leave when he comes to say goodbye to Bran and then chastises her husband Ned for leaving her and giving in to the demands of King Robert. Before they part, Jon asks Ned about his mother, and Ned promises to tell Jon about her the next time they meet. While stopping for a meal, Robert tells Ned that he has received word about Daenerys Targaryen's wedding to Khal Drogo and voices concern about the possibility of Viserys crossing the Narrow Sea with a Dothraki army to overthrow him with help from those in the Seven Kingdoms who still support the Targaryens' claim to the throne and think of Robert as a usurper.<br><br>Late one night after Ned's departure, a fire breaks out at Winterfell, and during the ensuing chaos, a hired assassin tries to kill Bran. Catelyn holds off the attacker long enough for Bran's direwolf to jump in and tear out the assassin's throat. The murder attempt arouses Catelyn's suspicions, and after finding a strand of long blonde hair in the abandoned tower where Bran fell, she concludes that the Lannisters are somehow involved. After confiding with her most trusted advisers - her son Robb, Maester Luwin, Master-at-Arms Ser Rodrik Cassel and the Starks' ward Theon Greyjoy - she decides to go to King's Landing in secret with Rodrik as her escort to warn her husband.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>Jon and Tyrion see the Wall for the first time as they arrive with Benjen and the other recruits. En route to the Wall, Tyrion and Jon discuss the Night's Watch. Tyrion is quick to disabuse Jon of his romantic notions of the Watch as a noble calling battling the mythical horrors beyond the Wall , pointing out that now it is more a dumping ground for the unwanted of Westeros: criminals, prisoners, and bastards.<br><br>At the Inn at the Crossroads<br><br>On their way to King's Landing, the king's entourage has stopped to rest at an inn. While the recently promised Prince Joffrey and Sansa Stark are walking along the river, they run into Arya sparring with sticks with her friend, a butcher's boy named Mycah. Taunting the boy, Joffrey draws his sword and demands a duel, under pretext of punishing him for accidentally hitting Arya, a member of the nobility. Mycah and Arya desperately explain that she asked him to spar with her so she could practice. As Joffrey savors the butcher boy's pain and fear, Arya hits Joffrey while her friend flees. Enraged, Joffrey turns on Arya and is about to strike her with his sword when her direwolf Nymeria bites his wrist. Arya seizes his sword and throws it into the river before running into the forest, where she drives away Nymeria and hides until dark.<br><br>Afterward, Joffrey lies to the courtly entourage and accuses Arya and her direwolf of ganging up on him. Unwilling to lose favor with her betrothed by publicly exposing his lie, Sansa claims she remembers nothing. Sick of the petty bickering, King Robert chastises his son for allowing himself to be disarmed by the younger girl and declares that the fathers themselves will punish their respective children, dismissing the audience. However, Robert gives in to his wife Cersei's demands and orders the direwolf killed. Since Nymeria has fled, Sansa's wolf, Lady, is to be sacrificed. Unable to convince the king otherwise, Eddard takes responsibility for killing Sansa's pet himself. As he walks to the back of the inn, he encounters Joffrey's bodyguard, Sandor "The Hound" Clegane, who has ridden down the butcher's boy and brought in his bloody corpse for the prince.<br><br>Eddard approaches Lady and holds her down as he unsheathes a blade. Saddened, he kills the direwolf, who utters a sharp cry of pain. Meanwhile, up North, Bran suddenly awakens from his coma and opens his eyes.</p></div></div>

As punishment, Viserys is choked and nearly killed by Daenerys's bloodrider Rakharo and is forced to walk back to camp after Daenerys intervenes to spare his life.<br><br>Irri notices that Daenerys is pregnant and shares the news with Jorah and Rakharo. Rather than be pleased, Jorah mysteriously departs for the Free City of Qohor for supplies. In their tent, Daenerys reveals to Drogo that their child is a boy.<br><br>In Winterfell<br><br>With Bran now awake, Old Nan tells him a tale of a long-ago endless winter, when the White Walkers first appeared riding their dead horses and raising Wights from the men they slaughtered. Her story is interrupted by Robb who sadly confirms to Bran that his injuries are permanent, and he'll never walk again. Bran, saying he is unable to remember anything about his fall, wishes he were dead.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>Jon has joined the other recruits under the firm hand of Ser Alliser Thorne and easily beats every opponent sent against him. Ser Alliser berates them all for their poor performance, but has no kind words for Jon, dubbing him "Lord Snow" to mock his bastard heritage and telling him that he's "the least useless person here." Disheartened, Jon asks Benjen to take him in a several-month-long ranging north of the Wall, but his uncle blocks this, telling Jon that "here, a man gets what he earns when he earns it."<br><br>Tyrion tells Jon that he isn't "better" than any of his new "brothers", but only more fortunate, as he was trained by a master-at-arms, while the others are all orphan boys or criminals who have likely never held a sword before today. To make amends, Jon decides to give his fellow recruits proper sword training. Later, Tyrion is beseeched by Lord Commander Jeor Mormont and the elderly, blind Maester Aemon to ask his sister and brother-in-law for more men for the Night's Watch, as the wildlings are massing in numbers greater than the Watch is able to deal with, and rumours that the White Walkers have returned are becoming more widespread. Tyrion is skeptical, but agrees to do so. Before leaving the Wall, Tyrion fulfills his ambition to urinate off the top of the Wall and says goodbye to Jon, who finally accepts Tyrion as a friend.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Eddard's party arrives at King's Landing. Eddard is immediately summoned to a meeting of the king's Small Council. On his way through the throne room, Eddard encounters Jaime Lannister, and the audience is told that Jaime killed the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, the father of Daenerys and Viserys Targaryen. Jaime reminds Eddard that Aerys had murdered Eddard's father and brother; however, Eddard does not consider this grounds for Jaime to break his oath as a knight of the Kingsguard.<br><br>Eddard joins the Small Council, consisting of the king's brother, Lord Renly, the eunuch Lord Varys, Grand Maester Pycelle and the Master of Coin Lord Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish. Littlefinger had once dueled Eddard's brother for Catelyn's hand in marriage and implies that he is still in love with her. Renly announces that Robert plans to hold a great tourney in honor of Eddard's appointment as the Hand of the King. Eddard learns that the crown is heavily indebted, primarily to the queen's father, Lord Tywin Lannister.<br><br>Catelyn arrives in King's Landing, supposedly in secret. However, she is taken by a pair of city watchmen to a brothel owned by Littlefinger. He meets her to tell her that he had her brought there to keep her safe and hidden. Varys, also present, reveals that he learned of Catelyn's arrival through his spies. The three of them and Ser Rodrik discuss the attempted murder of Bran. Littlefinger shocks them all by admitting that the assassin's dagger was once his own. He claims that he lost it to Tyrion Lannister, betting on Jaime Lannister to win a previous tourney. Littlefinger arranges a meeting between Eddard and Catelyn, and Eddard reluctantly takes on Littlefinger as an ally who will help them find Bran's assailant.<br><br>Eddard returns to his keep, only to find his daughters arguing. Arya is furious at Sansa for lying to protect Joffrey Baratheon. Ned reminds her that Joffrey is a prince and will be king one day with Sansa as his wife. Learning that his younger daughter aspires to be a swordsman and has a sword of her own, he hires the Braavosi "water dancer"  Syrio Forel to teach her the art of swordsmanship.</p></div></div>
                          <div class="no example"><h4 class="ui header">E04 - Cripples Bastards and Broken Things </h4>
                                                                        <div class="ui message"><p>In King's Landing<br><br>Lord Eddard Stark begins quietly inquiring into the death of Jon Arryn, the previous Hand of the King, who had long served as the Kingdom's chief administrative nobleman. Questioning Grand Maester Pycelle, who tended Jon Arryn in his final days, Stark learns that Arryn's last words were "the seed is strong" and that he was reading a book titled The Lineages and Histories of the Great Houses of the Seven Kingdoms.<br><br>Helped by Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish and his net of informers, Eddard follows up on two more clues regarding the last days of his predecessor. He questions a smith's apprentice whom Jon Arryn had visited in his last days and, due to his resemblance to King Robert, Stark deduces that the boy is the king's bastard. Eddard also plans to question Jon Arryn's former squire, but the recently knighted young man is killed while jousting at the tournament held in Eddard's honor. The knight responsible for his untimely end is Ser Gregor Clegane, also known as "The Mountain" due to his towering size. He is a Lannister bannerman and is the older brother of "The Hound" Sandor Clegane. Baelish tells Sansa the secret of the Clegane brothers: as children, Gregor brutally burned his brother's face, thus explaining the Hound's scars.<br><br>In Vaes Dothrak<br><br>Khal Drogo's khalasar arrives at the city of Vaes Dothrak. Viserys Targaryen impatiently waits for the army Drogo agreed to lend him, the bride price offered for his sister Daenerys, to reconquer the Seven Kingdoms. When Viserys misinterprets Daenerys's invitation to dinner as an order, he becomes angry and strikes her. For the first time, Daenerys fights back, hitting her astounded brother and promising that if he raises a hand against her again, his hands will be cut off. Later, the banished knight Jorah Mormont tells her that Viserys would not be a good leader for the invasion of Westeros and, despite what Viserys believes, the people of the Seven Kingdoms do not care who rules them as long as they are ruled well. Daenerys agrees that Viserys could not conquer the Seven Kingdoms even if Khal Drogo gave him an entire army.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>The Night's Watch receives Samwell Tarly, a fat, fearful and clumsy recruit who rapidly becomes the focus of bullying by master-at-arms Ser Alliser Thorne. Sam later explains to Jon that his father forced him to "take the Black" and forsake his inheritance because he considered Sam unworthy, threatening to kill Sam and pass his death off as a hunting accident if he refused.[3] Jon Snow defends Sam and convinces the rest of the recruits not to harm him, much to Thorne's rage. Thorne defends his treatment as essential, since life north of the Wall is very harsh especially during winter, warning Jon and Sam to toughen up or they will have no chance of survival.<br><br>In the North<br><br>Tyrion stops at Winterfell as he is returning to King's Landing after his visit to the Wall. He gets a cold welcome from Robb Stark, acting Lord of Winterfell in his father Eddard's absence. Robb suspects the Lannisters are behind his younger brother Bran's fall and the subsequent assassination attempt. Despite the cold reception, Tyrion shows the now crippled Bran an act of kindness by giving him blueprints for a saddle that will allow him to ride again despite his paralysis. Before he leaves Winterfell, Tyrion has a talk with Theon Greyjoy, a ward of House Stark, and mocks him regarding how the Greyjoys and their land, the Iron Islands, attempted a failed rebellion against King Robert, calling Theon a "hostage" to the Stark family.<br><br>At the Inn at the Crossroads<br><br>Further south, Tyrion and his small retinue stop to spend the night at the Inn at the Crossroads. There he recognizes Lady Catelyn Stark in disguise. With her identity revealed, she requests help from her father's bannermen present at the inn to seize Tyrion to face trial for Bran's attempted murder.</p></div></div>

However, they are soon attacked by barbarian tribesmen. During the fight, Tyrion saves Catelyn's life, attacking and killing a barbarian with a shield. The party arrives at the Eyrie, ruled by Lord Jon Arryn's widow, Lysa, who is also Catelyn's sister. However, when the two meet for the first time in five years, it becomes apparent that Lysa is mentally unstable and fears the Lannisters' power. Catelyn also meets her nephew, Robin Arryn, the heir to the Eyrie – an eight-year-old boy whom Lysa still breast-feeds. Tyrion is consigned to the Eyrie's version of a dungeon, the "sky cells", prison cells with an open wall and slanted floors that slope down to a precipice. Meanwhile, Lysa prepares to pass judgment on Tyrion as an accomplice in her husband's murder.<br><br>In the North<br><br>At Winterfell, Theon Greyjoy grows jealous of Tyrion after his favorite prostitute Ros taunts him with the judgment that Tyrion is a better lover and from a richer family. Meanwhile, Bran is depressed over his paralysis and the fact that his mother left him while he was in a coma. To cheer him up, Maester Luwin decides to teach Bran the Dothraki art of horseback archery.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>After Eddard Stark convinces King Robert not to join the tourney, the crowd watches a jousting match between the fearsome Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane, brother of the Hound, and Ser Loras Tyrell, the "Knight of Flowers". The Mountain is a formidable opponent, but Loras cleverly defeats him in the joust by riding a mare in heat, distracting Clegane's stallion. Furious, Clegane beheads his horse and attempts to kill Loras. Sandor "The Hound" Clegane comes to Tyrell's rescue and defends him against his brother until Robert orders them to stop. Grateful for being rescued, Loras calls Sandor a hero when he is cheered by the crowd.<br><br>Later, Varys reveals to Ned that Jon Arryn was killed for asking questions, succumbing to a poison called the "Tears of Lys". He also suggests that Lord Arryn's former squire, the recently slain Ser Hugh of the Vale, was the poisoner.<br><br>Meanwhile, Arya, as part of her training, chases a cat through the Red Keep and stumbles upon a secret conversation between two men , who appear to be plotting against the throne. Arya tries to warn her father, but is unable to identify the two plotters and fumbles her words. They are interrupted by the arrival of Yoren, who informs Ned of his wife's arrest of Tyrion.<br><br>The news of Daenerys's pregnancy reaches the Small Council, delivered by one of Varys's spies. Fearing a possible invasion by the Targaryen/Dothraki alliance, Robert orders that she and her unborn child, along with Viserys, be assassinated. Ned refuses to obey such a dishonorable order since Robert's hatred for Targaryens is clouding his judgment and ordering such an assassination will make him no better than the Mad King. When Robert's mind is clearly made, Ned resigns the office of Hand of the King, much to Robert's anger. As Robert drinks in sorrow over his fight with Ned, Cersei visits Robert and he explains why he takes the Dothraki threat seriously. Meanwhile, Robert's youngest brother Renly is with his lover, Ser Loras. Loras convinces Renly that he should be king because Loras believes that Renly would be a better ruler than either his brothers or nephews.<br><br>Before he can leave the capital, Littlefinger offers to take Ned to the last person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. It turns out to be a prostitute, Mhaegan, the mother of a baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims responsibility for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own.

After, Tyrion publicly demands a trial by combat, and the mercenary Bronn volunteers to fight for him. Lysa Arryn has no choice but to allow it. Bronn defeats Lysa's champion Ser Vardis Egen by tiring the heavily armored knight and kicking him out the Moon Door, and Tyrion is allowed to walk free with Bronn as his escort, much to the dismay of the Tully sisters.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Eddard Stark awakens in his chambers with Robert Baratheon and Cersei Lannister watching him. Cersei accuses Eddard of kidnapping her brother, Tyrion, and claims Eddard was drunk and attacked Jaime first, but she is silenced by a slap from Robert. After she leaves, Robert tells Eddard that he cannot rule the kingdoms if the Lannisters and Starks are at war and insists that Eddard remain the Hand of the King, or else Robert will give the position to Jaime. Robert also informs Eddard that he will be regent while Robert is away on a hunting trip.<br><br>Meanwhile, Arya Stark deals with her father's injury and her loss of Jory during her sword-dance lessons; Syrio Forel tells her it's a perfect opportunity for her to learn to avoid distraction while fighting. In the Starks' common room, Sansa Stark and Septa Mordane are interrupted by Prince Joffrey Baratheon, who apologizes to Sansa for his earlier behavior and gives her a necklace, vowing that she will become his queen in an elaborate wedding ceremony. Sansa happily accepts the apology, unaware Joffrey has been forced into it by his mother.<br><br>While acting as regent, Eddard learns that Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane was spotted leading brigands and attacking villages in the Riverlands. Realizing this is revenge for Tyrion's arrest, Eddard orders Lord Beric Dondarrion to secure Gregor's arrest, strips him of his lands and titles, and summons his Lord Tywin Lannister to answer for Gregor's actions. Fearing war with the Lannisters and for his daughters' lives, he orders Arya and Sansa to return to Winterfell for their safety. Sansa protests and mentions her desire to have the blond-haired Joffrey's children; Eddard realizes something and re-reads the book of lineages of the Baratheon family. Doing so, he puts the pieces together: Joffrey does not have black hair like his father, his father's ancestors, and Robert's bastards whom he and Jon Arryn had been researching. Eddard concludes Joffrey is not Robert's real son.<br><br>In Vaes Dothrak<br><br>Daenerys Targaryen takes one of the dragon eggs and places it on a glowing-hot brazier.

Viserys storms off after a tense exchange of words between the two men.<br><br>Later, at a feast for Daenerys and Khal Drogo, a drunken Viserys draws his sword on his sister, threatening that if the Khal does not give him an army to take back the Seven Kingdoms, he will take back Daenerys and cut out her child. Khal Drogo agrees to give him the "golden crown" that he wants, and Viserys lets his guard down, allowing Drogo's bloodriders to restrain him. Drogo melts his belt in a stewpot, and Viserys realises to his horror that the "golden crown" is actually molten gold, which Drogo pours on his head. Daenerys watches her brother's painful death calmly, and coldly observes: "He was no dragon. Fire cannot kill a dragon."</p></div></div>

While Tywin chastises Jaime for causing the recent troubles with the Starks, he nevertheless believes this war is the perfect opportunity for the Lannisters to set up a dynasty as the new rulers of the Seven Kingdoms. Tywin gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, the seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion.<br><br>At Winterfell<br><br>The captured wildling Osha, now a servant of the Starks, is harassed by Theon Greyjoy, who warns her that if she had been arrested in his homeland the Iron Islands, she would have suffered a worse fate. As Maester Luwin tells Theon to leave her alone after witnessing Theon's sexual advance on her, he asks Osha why she and other wildlings are coming south from the Wall. She reveals they were fleeing from the White Walkers, who have apparently returned after millennia of slumber, and declares that every army in the Seven Kingdoms should be marching north to confront that threat.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>Benjen Stark's horse returns from north of the Wall without him, much to the worry of his nephew, Jon Snow. Later, to Jon's disappointment and anger, he is told he has been assigned as a steward to the Lord Commander instead of a ranger, like his uncle. Jon suspects Ser Alliser Thorne's involvement, as revenge for Jon defying him; however, Sam believes that this assignment may mean he is being groomed for command. As Jon and Sam take their vows near a heart tree, Jon's direwolf brings him a dismembered hand.<br><br>In Vaes Dothrak<br><br>Daenerys Targaryen attempts to convince Khal Drogo to return to her homeland and reclaim the throne of the Seven Kingdoms, but he is not interested. While Daenerys and her entourage go sightseeing at a market, Ser Jorah Mormont receives a pardon for him to return to the Seven Kingdoms from an informant of Lord Varys. Jorah realizes this means the order to assassinate Daenerys has been officially issued and quickly saves her from a wine merchant who tries to poison her. Drogo, angered by the attempt on his wife's life, vows to his followers that he will lead his people to cross the Narrow Sea to invade the Seven Kingdoms as revenge and reclaim the Iron Throne for his unborn son.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Ned confronts Queen Cersei, telling her that he knows Prince Joffrey and his siblings are not King Robert's children, but were incestuously fathered by her brother Jaime. Cersei defends her affair with Jaime, comparing it to the ancient Targaryen practice of wedding brothers to sisters and saying she tried to love Robert, but he refused to love her because he was still in love with Ned's deceased sister, Lyanna. Ned shows Cersei mercy and tells her to leave the capital with her children before he tells Robert the truth.<br><br>Unexpectedly, Lord Renly Baratheon returns and informs Ned that, while hunting, Robert was mortally wounded by a boar. On his deathbed, Robert dictates his will to Ned, in which Robert makes Ned the Lord Regent and Protector of the Realm until Joffrey comes of age. Ned writes down Robert's words, but instead of using "Joffrey," Ned writes "my rightful heir," making the succession ambiguous. Robert signs the will without reading this change in wording and begs Ned to make Joffrey a better man. Robert also tells Ned that he was wrong to have ordered Daenerys Targaryen's assassination and orders Ned to let her live.<br><br>Fearing Cersei and the Lannisters will use this time to their advantage, Renly tries to convince Ned they should raise an army and launch a coup d'état; however, Ned refuses him. Ned wants to ensure that the crown passes to the rightful heir: Stannis Baratheon, Robert and Renly's brother. Ned writes a letter to Stannis informing him of the situation, dispatching it to Dragonstone, Stannis' island fortress. Ned also reveals to Petyr "Littlefinger" Baelish the truth of Joffrey's heritage, to which Littlefinger suggests they allow Joffrey and the Lannisters to take the throne, and if Joffrey proves to be an unfit ruler, they can use the truth to overthrow him and make Renly the king instead. Ned refuses such treason, asking Littlefinger to secure the support of the City Watch to overpower Cersei's men-at-arms if they attempt to seize the throne.<br><br>By the time Robert dies, Renly has fled the capital, and Joffrey has already ordered his own coronation within a fortnight.

Ned orders his men to arrest Cersei and Joffrey. As both sides prepare to fight, the City Watch slaughters the Stark men while Littlefinger holds Ned with a knife at his throat, telling Ned that he should have listened to Littlefinger's advice about distrusting him.</p></div></div>

Lord Commander Mormont recognizes them as Benjen Stark's fellow rangers and orders their bodies examined. Sam points out that there is no sign of decay on their corpses, even though they have apparently been dead for weeks. Later, Mormont informs Jon about events in the south and warns him to keep his commitment to the Night's Watch. Jon loses his temper after Ser Alliser Thorne mocks Eddard Stark's treason. Enraged, Jon charges at Thorne with a knife but is held back by his companions and confined to his quarters by Mormont.<br><br>Later that night, Jon's direwolf Ghost behaves strangely, prompting Jon to investigate Mormont's quarters. As Jon enters, he is attacked by one of the dead rangers, returned to life as a wight. The undead monster is immune to Jon's sword, continuing to attack even after being run through and losing an arm. As Mormont enters, Jon throws a lantern at the wight, setting the wight ablaze and finally destroying it.

Daenerys Targaryen is dismayed by their brutality, and after seeing Dothraki raiders gather several village women for use as sex slaves, she orders Ser Jorah Mormont and her bodyguards to claim the women as hers. Challenged in front of Drogo, she defends her actions as her right as khaleesi, and demands that the raiders marry rather than enslave the women they desire. Impressed, Drogo sides with his wife, but the leading raider, Mago, is unimpressed and challenges the Khal to a duel. Mago is swiftly killed by Drogo, but not before inflicting a deep wound. Daenerys worries about the wound, and the Khal reluctantly allows one of the spared villagers, a healer by the name of Mirri Maz Duur, to treat his wounds.

As the three of them swap stories, Tyrion reveals that, when he was 16, he married a woman named Tysha whom Jaime and he had rescued. When his father Tywin learned of this, he made Jaime confess that Tysha was actually a hired prostitute. Tywin then made Tyrion watch as Lannister guardsmen all had sex with her, each paying her one silver coin provided by Lord Tywin.<br><br>Later, Tyrion is awakened by Bronn as a Stark force approaches.

However, Lord Frey has sealed off the bridge and refuses to let the army cross, so Catelyn negotiates on her son Robb's behalf. After some hard bargaining, Frey agrees to allow the Stark army to cross through The Twins and to commit some of his troops to the conflict with the Lannisters, but, in return, he wants Robb and his sister Arya to marry two of his children, to which Robb reluctantly agrees.<br><br>After crossing the river, Robb divides his forces, sending the aforementioned 2,000 men to distract Lord Tywin's army. Due to the false information Robb gave to the captured Lannister scout, Lord Tywin's force believes it is the whole Stark army.

Jon is upset, however, when Sam tells him about Robb's war against the Lannisters, feeling that he should be there to help Robb.<br><br>Maester Aemon summons Jon and explains to him the reason why members of the Night's Watch do not marry: it would force them to choose between their duty to the order or loyalty to their loved ones. Aemon knows this very well because he is actually Aemon Targaryen, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen's uncle and Daenerys's great-uncle, who dutifully and reluctantly stayed at the Wall while his family members were killed or exiled when the Targaryens were overthrown. Aemon advises Jon that he must choose either his duty to the Night's Watch or his family, but also warns that the consequences of his choice will haunt him for the rest of his life.<br><br>In Lhazar<br><br>Khal Drogo, delirious from an infection caused by the chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from his saddle, a sign of weakness among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed.

As he is dragged through the crowd, Ned notices Arya on the statue, and alerts the Night's Watch recruiter Yoren to her location. With Sansa, Cersei, Joffrey and the Small Council looking over him, Ned confesses to treason and swears fealty to Joffrey in front of the crowd. Satisfied, Sansa and Cersei ask Joffrey to spare Ned as Joffrey promised, but Joffrey breaks his promise and orders Ned to be executed. As Sansa watches in horror, Cersei, Varys and the Small Council attempt to intervene, and Arya tries to rescue Ned, only to be stopped by Yoren, who prevents her from seeing her father's execution.

When Joffrey tells her of his plans to add Robb's head to the collection, Sansa defies him by wishing to see his own head mounted there, for which Joffrey has Ser Meryn Trant slap her.

Arya's effort to conceal her true identity is further endangered when Petyr Baelish unexpectedly arrives at Tywin's chambers for a meeting. Forced to wait at the table and serve wine, Arya tries to conceal her face from Baelish.

Tywin is surprised to learn that Arya knows so much about Aegon and his sister-wives. Having deduced that she is highborn, he tells her that she says, "My lord," instead of, "M'lord," like a commoner would, and advises her that if she is trying to hide her highborn status, she should do it more carefully.

Catelyn Stark, with the assistance of Brienne of Tarth, is able to delay the execution until Robb returns from the Crag. Catelyn confronts Jaime about Alton's death and calls him a man without honor for breaking his vows. Jaime bitterly explains that his vows as a knight included requirements to defend the innocent, obey his father, and serve the king... but that his father despised his king, and his king was slaughtering the innocent, rendering his vows conflicting. Jaime considers concepts like "honor" and "loyalty" naive at best and hypocritical at worst. Jaime also asserts that he has only been intimate with Cersei and thus has more honor than Eddard Stark, Catelyn's late husband, who fathered the bastard Jon Snow. He baits and insults Catelyn by telling her that she must hate Jon as a living reminder of Ned's infidelity. This brings Catelyn to a breaking point and she asks for Brienne's sword.<br><br>In Qarth<br><br>Having lost her dragons, Daenerys Targaryen has difficulty trusting Xaro Xhoan Daxos when he tells her he did not take them. Later, Ser Jorah Mormont returns from his search for a ship and vows to Daenerys to find her dragons.

Quaithe informs Jorah that although she does not have the dragons, Daenerys is currently with the one who does. At a meeting of the Thirteen, Pyat Pree tells Daenerys that he has her dragons in the "House of the Undying."

Cersei tells Tyrion that she has kidnapped his prostitute lover and intends to hold her to ensure Joffrey's safety, but when Cersei orders her brought into the room Tyrion discovers that she has mistakenly kidnapped Ros instead of Shae. After promising Ros that he will free her, Tyrion angrily swears to Cersei that she will pay for what she has done.<br><br>Later, Tyrion tries to get Joffrey to understand the danger they face, but Joffrey's inexperience and arrogance leave Tyrion fearful for the coming battle. Varys informs Tyrion that Daenerys Targaryen is alive and that she now has three dragons. Tyrion, skeptical about the dragons, says that they will play that "game" later, since Stannis is their main concern now.<br><br>At sea<br><br>Davos Seaworth and King Stannis plan the siege of King's Landing, during which Stannis decries the disrespect his nobles show to Davos due to his low-born status, despite his excellent service. They recall memories of the siege of the Baratheon ancestral castle Storm's End, during which Stannis held the castle even in the face of starvation, until Davos heroically broke through the siege line with food supplies. Stannis comments on his bitterness over King Robert handing over Storm's End to Renly after the war and not him, and vows that he will aptly reward faithful service by making Davos his Hand once he takes the Iron Throne.<br><br>At Harrenhal<br><br>Lord Tywin Lannister decides to fight Robb Stark's army now that their attention is on the Greyjoys' capture of Winterfell and departs Harrenhal, leaving Ser Gregor Clegane at its command. Arya Stark tries to have Jaqen H'ghar kill Tywin before he leaves, using the last of three "lives" she was owed, but she is not able to find Jaqen in time. Instead, she decides to ask Jaqen to help them escape. Jaqen explains that an escape would cost more lives than their current bargain, and after some thought, Arya names Jaqen himself. After he asks her to take his name back, she does so on the condition that he help her escape with her friends Gendry and Hot Pie. He tells Arya that the three will be able to walk out safely if they do so at midnight that night. True to his word, Jaqen kills the entire evening's watch guarding the entrance to Harrenhal, allowing the three to escape.<br><br>In the Westerlands<br><br>King Robb returns from the Crag with Lady Talisa Maegyr and is informed of Jaime Lannister's escape and his mother's involvement. When Robb confronts Catelyn, she admits to having her knight Brienne of Tarth escort Jaime to King's Landing to trade for Sansa and Arya. Angered with his mother's betrayal, Robb has Catelyn placed under guard. Later, Lord Roose Bolton assures Robb that Bolton's bastard son is only a few days from Winterfell; Robb orders that mercy be shown to any surrendering Ironborn except Theon Greyjoy, hoping it will give Theon's men incentive to betray him. Bolton shows distaste with his king's merciful attitude but obeys. Lady Talisa then enters Robb's tent where he confides in her about his problems. After she tells him a story about why she chose to leave Volantis and become a healer, Robb confesses that he does not want to marry one of Lord Walder Frey's daughters. Talisa also wishes the same, and the two consummate their relationship.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>Jon Snow is presented to the Lord of Bones by Ygritte and her companions.

Soon after, Yara Greyjoy arrives with a few riders, which angers Theon, who had ordered his sister to send 500 men to help him hold the castle. Yara reveals she has come to Winterfell to bring him back home because his decision to execute the Stark boys will only bring the wrath of all the North down on his head. Despite Yara's pleas, Theon refuses because he fears that he will be seen as a coward if he abandons Winterfell.<br><br>Maester Luwin sees the wildling Osha stealing bread and retreating to the crypts beneath Winterfell. He follows her and discovers that both Bran and Rickon are alive and well. Osha explains that after reaching the farm, they had doubled back to Winterfell itself to evade Theon's patrols. Luwin deduces that Theon's men murdered a farming family and burned their sons' bodies in the Stark boys' stead. He asks Osha to keep it from Bran since he would blame himself, but Bran overhears their conversation.</p></div></div>

Before their arrival, Tyrion and Shae discuss the possibility of the Lannister defeat. Queen Regent Cersei is given a powerful poison by Grand Maester Pycelle to be used should the city fall, since she believes a victorious Stannis will eliminate the Lannister nobility. Outside the Red Keep, Bronn drinks and sings with his men, but the mood is soured by the arrival of Sandor "the Hound" Clegane. Tensions rise between Bronn and the Hound, but before they can fight, the bells ring, indicating Stannis' fleet has been spotted. Lord Varys brings Tyrion a map of the tunnels beneath King's Landing, as requested. Varys is unnerved by Stannis' associations with the dark arts, having heard he has begun a relationship with a Red Priestess. King Joffrey jubilantly leads the defending forces from the Red Keep, and orders his betrothed, Sansa Stark, to kiss his sword, vowing that he will use it to slay her brother Robb one day. The noble ladies and children are interned at Maegor's Holdfast and kept under watch by Ser Ilyn Payne, the royal executioner, who Cersei claims is present for their protection. Becoming drunk, Cersei has several pointed conversations with Sansa, mocking her innocence and warning her to expect to be raped should the city fall.<br><br>As Stannis's fleet closes in, they are confronted by a single ship from King's Landing heading for them, seemingly abandoned and unmanned. Davos realizes too late that it is a trap; the unmanned ship is rigged with the explosive chemical "wildfire" and explodes as Bronn fires a flaming arrow at the bay. Several ships are instantly destroyed, killing scores of Stannis' men, seemingly including Davos and his son Matthos. Stannis nevertheless orders his surviving army to beach via rowboat and begin the assault on the city's vulnerable Mud Gate. Tyrion orders the Hound to lead a counterstrike. The defenders are routed in the melee. Lancel is injured and flees back to Maegor's Holdfast, while the Hound, succumbing to his childhood fear of fire, deserts altogether after watching a charging soldier burn alive. Stannis himself storms the city battlements and is first up the ladder into the city. Almost unopposed, Stannis's men attack the Mud Gate with a battering ram. At the holdfast, Cersei attempts to interrogate Shae and nearly learns of her true origins, while Sansa learns of Ser Ilyn's true purpose in the hold: kill the holdfast's residents should Stannis take the city.<br><br>Lancel arrives at the holdfast and informs Queen Cersei that Stannis's men are at the gates. Cersei responds by ordering Lancel to bring Joffrey back from the battlements and into the safety of the Red Keep. Frightened, Joffrey agrees to leave the battlefield and orders one of the Kingsguard, Ser Mandon Moore, to represent him in his stead, sending morale plummeting amongst the defenders. Tyrion takes charge of the remaining men, rousing them with a speech and leading them through one of the tunnels from Varys' map, allowing them to flank the Baratheons. Lancel returns to the holdfast and demands that the king return to battle, causing Cersei to assault him and depart from the hold with her son Prince Tommen, leaving the other noble ladies alone with Ser Ilyn. Sansa rallies the panicking ladies with prayer but is convinced by Shae to flee from the hold to her quarters. When Sansa arrives at her chambers, she is startled by the Hound, who is fleeing the city and offers to take her north with him. Sansa initially declines his offer, although her final decision remains unclear.<br><br>Tyrion, having led his men through the tunnel, attacks the surprised Baratheon men from behind, defeating them with ease. They stop to celebrate their victory, but soon return to fighting as a larger group of Stannis's men arrive from nearby. As Tyrion fights, he is unexpectedly attacked by Ser Mandon and slashed across his face. Before Tyrion can be killed, his squire, Podrick Payne, kills Ser Mandon. Simultaneously Cersei is in the great hall with prince Tommen sitting on the Iron Throne and comforting him as the battle rages on at the city walls. She tells him a story about “The mother lion and her little cub” lion being the banner of House Lannister symbolizing her relationship with her children and all the other banners such as stags, wolves and bears as their enemies quoting “You are a lion my son, you mustn't be afraid”. As Tyrion slips into unconsciousness, he witnesses Stannis' army being suddenly struck by a surprise assault from a cavalry force led by Tywin Lannister. Stannis is seen cursing at his men to stand their ground, even as he is pulled away to safety. Cersei, having fled to the great hall with Prince Tommen, is about to give him the poison, when she is startled by the arrival of Ser Loras Tyrell , and her father, Lord Tywin Lannister, who declares that they have won the battle.</p></div></div>

For uniting the Houses of Tyrell and Lannister, the alliance which caused the victory, Lord Petyr Baelish is given the castle of Harrenhal. Ser Loras Tyrell asks for the king to wed Lady Margaery Tyrell, his sister, and though Joffrey insists he is bound by oath to Sansa Stark, Queen Regent Cersei Lannister and Grand Maester Pycelle argue that the gods will allow him to reject the oath on grounds of Eddard Stark's treason. Sansa is elated to be rid of Joffrey, but Baelish warns her that she is still in danger while she is in King's Landing, and offers to scheme to see her home safely. Lord Varys works to undermine Baelish's successes and plots to turn his associate, the prostitute Ros, against him.<br><br>Meanwhile, a scarred Tyrion Lannister wakes from the injuries that he received from the attempt on his life during the battle. With the arrival of Tywin, he has been removed from the position of Hand of the King and is left powerless and without allies, except for his squire, Podrick Payne. Lord Varys informs Tyrion that the Queen was behind the attempt on his life and says that he knows Tyrion to have been the true hero of the battle, even though he will receive no official credit. Tyrion is consoled by Shae, who remains loyal and tries to convince him to leave King's Landing for Pentos with her. Despite his fall from power, Tyrion refuses to leave King's Landing, saying that he has finally found a role that he both excels at and enjoys.<br><br>At Dragonstone<br><br>In a rage over his unexpected defeat at the Battle of Blackwater, Lord Stannis Baratheon blames Melisandre for goading him into war with promises of victory and attempts to strangle her in a fit of rage.

After informing Stannis that he will betray all that he has known in his quest to be king and assuring him it will be worth it in the end, Melisandre leads Stannis to a burning bowl of coal and has them together observe the dancing fire. As Stannis watches the flames, he seems to be struck by divine visions from the Lord of Light, restoring his faith in Melisandre.<br><br>In the Westerlands<br><br>Brienne of Tarth continues in her mission to escort the prisoner Jaime Lannister to King's Landing, in exchange for Sansa and Arya Stark.

Before departing, Jaqen hands Arya a special coin and the phrase "Valar morghulis," which Arya may use to seek him if she meets anyone from Braavos.

Pyat Pree's magic quickly leaves Jorah and Kovarro stranded outside while trapping Daenerys in the stronghold. As she walks through the stronghold, Daenerys is struck with visions of places such as a ruined and snowbound Red Keep, and the Haunted Forest. She encounters her deceased husband, Khal Drogo, and their stillborn son Rhaego, both apparently alive and well. Although unsure whether she is dreaming, Daenerys leaves when she hears her dragons.

Cersei visits Tyrion and questions what he will say to their father. When Tyrion meets with Tywin, who has assumed the role of Hand of the King, Tywin reluctantly agrees to Tyrion's request for recognition of his accomplishments during the Battle of Blackwater. However, when pressed by Tyrion to name him heir to Casterly Rock, the Lannister ancestral home, Tywin refuses, and viciously insults Tyrion, calling him an embarrassment and a penance that he must suffer, also heavily implying that he does not believe Tyrion to be legitimate and making a mockery of the family name.

Sansa asks what Tyrion will do if that never happens, and Tyrion jokes by saying a phrase from the Night's Watch vow, "And so my watch begins", meaning that he is resigned to never having sex within their marriage.<br><br>At Dragonstone<br><br>Melisandre returns to Dragonstone with Gendry. She then takes him to see King Stannis Baratheon, who recognizes Gendry as one of Robert's bastards. When Gendry is taken to his chamber, Stannis and Melisandre discuss what they intend to do with him.<br><br>In the dungeons, Davos Seaworth continues to learn to read. Stannis visits him to discuss Melisandre's plan to sacrifice Gendry. Davos objects to the plan, seeing Gendry as a nephew to Stannis, but Stannis remains resolved. He then makes Davos swear to never raise his hand to Melisandre again, and frees him.<br><br>Later, Melisandre visits Gendry and seduces him, tying him to a bed in the process. Having earlier stated that there is "power" in Gendry's kingly blood, she lays three leeches on him to draw his blood. Stannis enters and ritually burns the leeches, speaking the names of the usurpers to his throne: Robb Stark, Balon Greyjoy, and Joffrey Baratheon.<br><br>In the Riverlands<br><br>Arya tries to kill Sandor "the Hound" Clegane while he is sleeping, but he is revealed to be awake, and thwarts her attempt on his life. They depart their camp and head for the Twins, where Clegane intends to ransom Arya to her brother Robb.<br><br>At Yunkai<br><br>Ser Jorah Mormont tells Daenerys Targaryen that Yunkai has employed a mercenary group called the Second Sons, which is led by a man named Mero. Daenerys soon meets with Mero, his co-captain Prendahl na Ghezn and his lieutenant Daario Naharis. She attempts to bribe Mero to renege on his deal with Yunkai and fight for her, and gives him two days to make a decision. In the Second Sons' camp, the three leaders plot to kill Daenerys that night, with one of them sneaking into her camp. By random draw, Daario is selected to carry out their plot.<br><br>After nightfall, Daario enters Daenerys's camp, disguised as an Unsullied soldier. He enters her tent and shows her and Missandei the severed heads of Mero and Prendahl, admitting that he is smitten by Daenerys and killed his superiors after disagreeing with the plot to kill her. Daario then kneels and pledges himself and the Second Sons to her cause.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>Samwell Tarly and Gilly continue their journey to the Wall. They stop at an abandoned hut for the night and discuss a name for her son. When they hear a murder of crows cawing nearby, Sam leaves the hut to investigate. Soon after, he is attacked by a White Walker, which shatters Sam's sword with a single touch and tosses him aside. The Walker moves towards Gilly, intent on taking her son, but Sam stabs it with his dragonglass dagger, causing the Walker to disintegrate. Sam and Gilly then flee into the night.</p></div></div>

Sam tells Gilly he plans for them to cross the Wall using the entrance at the Nightfort, an abandoned castle along the Wall.<br><br>In the North<br><br>South of the Wall, Bran and his group take shelter in an abandoned mill. Nearby, Jon and the wildling party raid an elderly horse breeder's home, taking his horses and gold while the old man flees. While in the mill, Bran and Jojen Reed discuss how they plan to cross the Wall, before Meera spots the old horse breeder riding nearby. After the old man is captured by the wildlings, Hodor—scared by the thunder—begins yelling, which threatens to give away their location to the wildlings. Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and knocks him out.<br><br>Outside, Tormund moves to kill the old man, but Orell tells him to have Jon do it instead to prove his loyalty. Jon is ultimately unable to kill the innocent man, and instead Ygritte kills the man with an arrow. Realizing where Jon's loyalties lie, Tormund orders his men to kill him, but Jon manages to defeat them. As Ygritte moves to defend him, Jon deliberately knocks her to the ground, allowing Tormund to hold her down and prevent her from getting killed, while he battles with Orell. Bran enters the mind of Summer, his direwolf, and aids Jon. Jon kills Orell while the wolves hold off the other wildlings, and is then able to steal a horse and escape, leaving Ygritte and heading back to the Wall. At night, Bran asks Osha to take Rickon to Last Hearth, the home of the Umber family, and they depart shortly after.<br><br>In Yunkai<br><br>Planning their invasion of Yunkai, Daario tells Daenerys and her knights about a rear gate to the city, through which they can sneak in and open the main gate for her army. Ser Jorah is suspicious of Daario and his plan, but comes around when Daenerys seeks Grey Worm's opinion. When night falls, Daario, Jorah, and Grey Worm arrive at the gate. Daario enters ahead of them, posing as a still loyal Second Son commander. Shortly after being let inside the city, he signals Jorah and Grey Worm to follow him. Soon, they are ambushed by a group of Yunkai's slave soldiers, and though largely outnumbered, manage to kill them and accomplish the mission. The group returns to Daenerys, and tells her that she is now in control of the city.<br><br>At the Twins<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>The dagger with which Roose Bolton kills Robb Stark, and the knife with which Catelyn Stark kills Walder Frey's wife.<br><br><br><br><br><br>At camp, Catelyn counsels her son Robb, the King in the North, about his planned alliance with Lord Walder Frey and his planned assault on Casterly Rock, the homeland of the Lannisters. The Stark host soon arrives at the Twins, castle homeland of the Freys, where they are given bread and salt, a symbol of the "guest right": a guarantee of safety when under another lord's roof. Robb makes an apology to both the sarcastic Walder Frey and his daughters. Walder accepts the apology but insists on inspecting Talisa, the woman for whom Robb broke his vow. Nearby, Arya, though still a captive of Sandor Clegane, journeys to the Twins to reunite with her mother and brother. When they come upon a trader and his cart, Clegane knocks him out and moves to kill him, but Arya manages to dissuade him, and he instead steals the cart of food.<br><br>At night, Walder walks his daughter Roslin down the aisle to her future husband Edmure Tully, who is pleasantly surprised by her beauty. They are married shortly after, and the celebration begins. At the feast, Walder calls for the bedding ceremony, and the couple are taken to their chamber. After they leave, Lothar Frey closes the banquet hall doors, and the Frey bards begin playing "The Rains of Castamere", a Lannister cautionary song, both of which arouse Catelyn's suspicions. Using the food cart as their reason for being at the Twins, the Hound and Arya arrive at the wedding. They are turned away at the gates, but Arya sneaks in.<br><br>Catelyn notices Roose Bolton wearing chainmail under his robes which confirms Catelyn's suspicions that they have been betrayed. Just as Walder signals his men to attack the Starks' men, Catelyn tries to warn Robb, but before he can react, Lothar repeatedly stabs the pregnant Talisa in the uterus, killing her and her unborn child. As he tries to draw his sword, Robb is shot by crossbows, and the massacre of his bannermen begins. Arya, having snuck past the gate, witnesses Frey men kill Stark soldiers and Robb's direwolf, Grey Wind. She is saved by the Hound, who knocks her unconscious and carries her out of the castle. Catelyn, although wounded by a crossbow bolt, holds Walder's young wife, Joyeuse, hostage with a knife and demands that Robb be allowed to leave. Walder refuses, and Roose Bolton stabs Robb in the heart, delivering Jaime's message from Harrenhal, "The Lannisters send their regards." Catelyn screams and kills Joyeuse in retaliation, before Frey's son Black Walder cuts Catelyn's throat.</p></div></div>

At a Small Council meeting, Tyrion learns of the deaths of Robb and Catelyn Stark during the Red Wedding. King Joffrey orders Robb's head brought to King's Landing, planning to gift it to Sansa, the prospect of which makes Tyrion threaten Joffrey. Joffrey angrily threatens Tyrion in return, and insults Tywin when he reprimands him. Tywin, showing Joffrey he does not fear him, orders he be taken to his room and sedated. Tywin and Tyrion later discuss the murder at the Twins, and the appointment of Roose Bolton as the Warden of the North, until the son of Tyrion and Sansa is of age. Tywin dismisses Tyrion's warning that the northerners will neither forget nor forgive the role the Lannisters played in the Red Wedding. Tywin then chastises Tyrion for not having impregnated Sansa. Tyrion finds Sansa in his bedroom, staring forlornly out the window with a tear-stained face, revealing she has already received the grim news.<br><br>Elsewhere, Lord Varys and Shae discuss their shared eastern heritage, Tyrion's marriage to Sansa, and its effect on Shae. Varys gives Shae a bag of diamonds in the hopes that she will sail for Essos and make a new life for herself, freeing Tyrion from danger and allowing him to focus on making the capital a better place, but Shae refuses the offer and believes Varys was sent by Tyrion. At night, Queen Cersei visits Tyrion and tells him to give Sansa a child, as it will make Sansa happy as it did for Cersei when Joffrey was born.<br><br>Jaime, Brienne, and Qyburn arrive in King's Landing, and Jaime immediately goes to see Cersei.<br><br>At the Twins<br><br>Shortly after the murder of their king, the loyal Stark bannermen fight a losing battle with the Freys outside the walls of the Twins. "The Hound" Sandor Clegane and Arya are horrified to witness several Frey soldiers parade Robb's decapitated corpse around the entrance to the keep with the head of Robb's wolf, Grey Wind, attached to it. Later, Arya and the Hound come upon four Frey men discussing the murder of the Starks. Arya slips off the horse and brutally kills one of the soldiers who claimed to have desecrated Robb's body. Before his allies can aid him, the Hound steps in and easily kills them.<br><br>The morning after the wedding, Walder Frey and Roose Bolton discuss the previous night's events, the escape of the "Blackfish" Brynden Tully, and their new positions as Lord of Riverrun and Warden of the North, respectively. When Walder asks Bolton what happened during the fall of Winterfell, Bolton explains that he sent his bastard son, Ramsay Snow to take the castle back from the Greyjoys. Bolton's plan to offer the Ironborn safe passage in exchange for surrendering Theon worked, but Ramsay flayed and killed the surrendering Ironborn despite his father intending the offer be made in good faith.<br><br>In the North<br><br>Bran, Hodor, Meera Reed, and Jojen arrive at the abandoned Nightfort. Later, Bran is awakened by a sound, and wakes his companions. They meet Samwell Tarly and Gilly; Sam deduces Bran's identity, seeing his direwolf. Bran asks Sam to take them north of the Wall, and though Sam protests the idea, he eventually takes them through the passage. Before they separate, Sam gives the group the rest of his dragonglass supply, and tells them that it has the power to kill White Walkers. Sam and Gilly later arrive at Castle Black, where they present themselves to Maester Aemon, who allows Gilly and her baby to stay. Aemon, on hearing the recount of events, orders all the ravens be sent with messages warning the return of the White Walkers.<br><br>Riding back to the Wall, Jon stops to wash his wounds when he hears Ygritte draw her bow. He tries to talk her out of shooting him, but when he turns to leave, she fires three arrows into him. Jon manages to escape, later arriving at Castle Black and passing out from his wounds. The Night's Watch brothers take him in, where Sam and Pyp identify him so that he is cared for.<br><br>At the Dreadfort, Ramsay Snow, the true identity of the mysterious boy, taunts Theon about his castration. When Theon begs Ramsay to kill him and end his suffering, Ramsay simply replies that he is more valuable alive, before giving him the nickname "Reek", and beating him until he acknowledges his new name.<br><br>On the Iron Islands<br><br>Lord Balon Greyjoy reads a letter sent from Ramsay Snow, crudely detailing his demands to have the Ironborn soldiers withdraw from the region of the North under his control, threatening to flay the soldiers if they do not comply. It is also revealed in the letter that Ramsay broke his promise and flayed the 20 ironborn that betrayed Theon in Winterfell. Ramsay also sends a box containing Theon's severed penis, adding that he could further dismember Balon's son. To the protests of his daughter Yara, Balon plans to refuse the offer and allow Theon's torture to continue. Yara disobeys her father's decision and takes 50 of the Ironborn's best men and the fastest ship available to march on the Dreadfort.<br><br>At Dragonstone<br><br>In the dungeons, Davos visits Gendry and tries to relate to him by telling the story of how he became a lord. Later, Davos practises his reading with Princess Shireen, when he reads the letter sent by the Night's Watch. When they hear the bells ringing, Davos leaves Shireen to meet with Stannis and Melisandre. Stannis informs Davos of Robb Stark's death, which he attributes to Melisandre's ritualistic burning of the leeches. Melisandre plans to burn Gendry as a sacrifice to the Lord of Light, and although Davos tries to get Stannis to spare Gendry, Stannis orders him to be sacrificed. At night, Davos frees Gendry from the dungeons and gives him a boat to escape Dragonstone.<br><br>Afterward, Stannis and Melisandre ask Davos if he freed Gendry, which he does not deny. Stannis orders Davos to be executed, but Davos tells Stannis that he will need his assistance. When Stannis asks why he would need Davos' help, Davos shows him the letter sent from the Wall. Melisandre burns the letter, and in the fire sees the war coming in the North. She tells Stannis that only he can save the North, and he will need Davos's help to do so, thus preventing his execution.<br><br>Across the Narrow Sea<br><br>Outside Yunkai, Daenerys, her advisors, and her Unsullied army stand ready to greet the slaves of the city and free them. When they arrive, Missandei tells them that Daenerys has freed them, but Daenerys tells the slaves that only they can take their freedom back. The crowd begins to chant "mhysa", which Missandei tells Daenerys is Ghiscari for "mother". Daenerys passes her army to walk amongst the freed slaves, who lift her to their shoulders. Daenerys smiles and looks up into the sky as her dragons fly freely.</p></div></div>

One is given to his son Jaime, who, as the new Lord Commander of the Kingsguard, hopes to learn to use the sword with his left hand. Tywin informs Jaime that he is to be dismissed from the Kingsguard and sent to Casterly Rock to rule in his place, but Jaime refuses and leaves. He attempts to return the sword, but Tywin tells him to keep it, as he will need every advantage he can find now that he has been disowned.<br><br>Outside the city walls, Tyrion, his squire Podrick, and his bodyguard Bronn await the arrival of Prince Doran Martell and his entourage, but are informed that his younger brother, Prince Oberyn, will be attending in his stead. Oberyn, having already arrived, maims a Lannister soldier at one of Lord Baelish's whorehouses before Tyrion arrives. Oberyn reveals to Tyrion that he is in King's Landing to seek vengeance for the death of his sister, Elia, and her two children. Elia had been married to Prince Rhaegar Targaryen, who was next in line to the throne before Robert Baratheon killed him, and King's Landing fell to Tywin's army. Oberyn wants to kill Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane, who is rumored to have raped and murdered Elia during the siege, and suggests that Ser Gregor was acting upon orders from Tywin himself.<br><br>At lunch, Shae tries in vain to get Sansa to eat. Sansa reveals to Tyrion that she cannot eat or sleep since hearing of how Robb and Catelyn Stark's bodies were desecrated after their murders . Sansa leaves for the godswood, where she is approached by Dontos Hollard, the former knight turned king's fool. Dontos thanks Sansa for saving his life on Joffrey's name-day celebration , and gives her his mother's necklace as a token of his gratitude.<br><br>Tyrion returns to his chamber where he rebuffs Shae's attempts to rekindle their romance, and their argument is overheard by another of Sansa's handmaidens. Meanwhile, Jaime is fitted with a gilded steel hand by Qyburn. When he departs, Jaime and his twin sister, Cersei, discuss the state of their relationship before being interrupted by Sansa's handmaiden, with information for the Queen. Later, King Joffrey chastises Jaime for his absence during the Battle of the Blackwater and also makes fun of his age, the loss of his sword hand, and his lack of accomplishment as a member of the Kingsguard. Afterwards, Brienne tries to convince Jaime to follow through on his vow to return the Stark girls to safety, though Jaime argues the matter is now complicated by Catelyn Stark's death, Sansa's marriage to Tyrion and that Arya Stark has been missing ever since Ned Stark was executed .<br><br>In the gardens, Lady Olenna Tyrell and her granddaughter, Margaery, plan the royal wedding before Brienne of Tarth asks for a word with Margaery to discuss how Lord Renly was killed .

Slynt calls for Jon to be executed as a traitor, and Thorne, who is acting Lord Commander of the Night's Watch following the death of Commander Jeor Mormont, is inclined to agree with him. However, Maester Aemon is convinced of Jon's ultimate loyalty to the Night's Watch and has him released.<br><br>In Slaver's Bay<br><br>Daenerys Targaryen leads her army on the march to Meereen, the third slaving city of Slaver's Bay. Daenerys becomes disturbed at how her dragons are growing less tame as they grow larger. As they march, Daario Naharis attempts to romance Daenerys, and warns her that if she plans to rule the land, she must learn more about the lifestyle and the culture of the slaves she is freeing. The march is halted by the discovery of a dead slave girl nailed to a mile-post pointing the route to Meereen. Ser Jorah explains that there is one dead child slave nailed to every mile marker on the road to Meereen. Ser Barristan offers to send men ahead to bury them, but Daenerys coldly informs him that she will look upon every dead child's face during the march.<br><br>In the Riverlands<br><br>Sandor "The Hound" Clegane tells the captive Arya Stark that he intends to ransom her to her Aunt Lysa in the Vale, before they come across an inn hosting several of the Mountain's men, Lannister soldiers. Among them, Arya recognises Polliver, the man who stole her sword, Needle, and killed Lommy Greenhands. She makes for the entrance before being stopped by the Hound, but they are discovered by one of the soldiers and enter the inn. Though several of the soldiers are fearful of the Hound, Polliver makes conversation with him and offers him a place in their band. After Sandor refuses and the two men trade insults, they engage in a fight. The Hound kills many of the soldiers, while Arya reclaims Needle from Polliver and uses it to kill him the same way he murdered Lommy .

When Ramsay's father, Roose, arrives at the Dreadfort with his new wife, Walda , he asks to see Reek and chastises Ramsay for having castrated and tortured him. Roose intended to trade Reek to the Ironborn in exchange for Moat Cailin, a fortification that is preventing the Bolton army from returning to the north, which forced Roose and his party to have to be smuggled back to their own keep. Ramsay, in an effort to prove how well he has broken him, has Reek shave his face. While doing so, Ramsay coaxes Reek into admitting to Roose that both Bran and Rickon Stark are alive, as he could not find them, and burned two farm boys in their place while holding Winterfell. Ramsay also spitefully tells Reek that Roose betrayed and murdered Robb Stark who had once been like a brother to Theon. Despite this, a visibly emotional Reek completes his shave without harming Ramsay, thus proving his trustworthiness. Roose dispatches Locke to find and kill Bran and Rickon, because while they are alive they pose a threat to his new position as Warden of the North. Ramsay suggests that they also find and eliminate Jon Snow, who has Stark blood in him and will also likely oppose the Boltons. Roose also orders Ramsay, along with Reek, to capture Moat Cailin, implying that he will reward Ramsay by legitimizing him as a true Bolton.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>Bran, while using his abilities as a warg, sees through the eyes of his direwolf, Summer, and kills a doe. Awoken by the voice of Hodor, he is then reminded to use the warg abilities sparingly by Jojen and Meera, as spending too much time as Summer will cut him off from his human body. After stopping at a weirwood, Bran has a vision of the three-eyed raven, his father, dragons flying over King's Landing, and his paralyzing fall at Winterfell. In the vision he hears, "Look for me, beneath the tree...north." Bran reveals that he knows where the group must go.[4]<br><br>At Dragonstone<br><br>At night, Melisandre orders several of Stannis Baratheon's subjects burned at the stake, including Lady Selyse's brother Ser Axell Florent, as a tribute to the Lord of Light. At a private dinner with Stannis, his wife Selyse, and Melisandre, Selyse expresses her disgust towards her daughter, causing Stannis to angrily defend the girl. After dinner, Melisandre speaks to Shireen Baratheon, Stannis and Selyse's daughter, about the Lord of Light and how the Seven Gods are a lie. Despite her young age and sheltered life, Shireen appears somewhat suspicious of Melisandre and cautiously talks with her.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Jaime reveals to Tyrion his embarrassment at the loss of his sword hand. Tyrion encourages him to train his left hand and arranges for clandestine lessons with Bronn, provided he is paid. On the way to the wedding breakfast, Lord Varys informs Tyrion that the Queen knows about Shae and will soon tell their father, Tywin. Lord Mace Tyrell presents King Joffrey with a large gold goblet, and Tyrion gives him a rare book, before he is presented with the second Valyrian steel sword that Tywin had forged. Joffrey uses the sword to slice through the large book. In his chambers, Tyrion tries in vain to get Shae to leave, but succeeds only when he lies that he could never love a whore. Bronn escorts the forlorn Shae to the boat and later assures Tyrion that she has indeed left for Essos and is out of harm's way.<br><br>Before the wedding, Tywin and Lady Olenna trade barbs at one another. Olenna reminds Tywin of the debt the Crown now owes to the Iron Bank of Braavos. Jaime threatens Ser Loras Tyrell by telling him that should he wed Cersei, she would likely kill him in his sleep, and Loras retorts with an implication that he knows of Jaime and Cersei's incestuous affair. Brienne of Tarth is confronted by Cersei, who accuses her of being in love with Jaime. Margaery announces that the leftovers from the feast will be given to the city's poorest residents, earning much acclaim. Cersei, bitter at her loss of power and disapproving of Joffrey's new queen, confronts Grand Maester Pycelle and threatens to execute him if he does not leave the wedding and command the feast chefs to give the leftovers to the royal hounds instead. Tywin and Cersei are later confronted by Prince Oberyn and his paramour, Ellaria Sand. The four share a tense conversation filled with veiled insults, as well as Oberyn's note that Cersei's daughter, Myrcella, is currently being held in Dorne.<br><br>Joffrey then presents a crude play with dwarves depicting the War of the Five Kings, to the amusement of some guests but to the disgust of many others. Loras leaves in anger when his relationship with Renly Baratheon is mocked by the play. Tyrion is infuriated at the distasteful spectacle. Sansa is nearly brought to tears by the depiction of her recently deceased brother, Robb. Joffrey tries to get Tyrion involved in the play due to his size, but Tyrion refuses, instead requesting Joffrey display his own talent with a sword. Humiliated, Joffrey orders Tyrion to be his cupbearer, toying with him by intentionally dropping and kicking the goblet.<br><br>Eventually, Tyrion fills the goblet and hands it to Joffrey, who repeatedly orders his uncle to kneel, but Tyrion is defiant. Margaery defuses the situation by drawing attention to the wedding pie. As Joffrey eats the cake that Margaery gives him and drinks wine from the goblet Tyrion gave him, he begins choking. While the emergency draws the crowd's attention, court fool Dontos implores Sansa to flee with him. As Lady Olenna yells for everyone to assist the king, he falls to the ground, the clear victim of assassination by poison. Before dying, Joffrey points accusingly at Tyrion, who is examining the dropped goblet. Furious with grief, Cersei orders Tyrion arrested on charges of poisoning the king.</p></div></div>

Baelish also reveals that the necklace Dontos gave to Sansa was a fake and part of the ruse.<br><br>In the city gardens, Olenna and Margaery discuss Joffrey's murder, and how, as their marriage was unconsummated, she is not the Queen. In the Sept, Tywin speaks to Tommen about becoming the king and the qualities that a king must possess, then leaves Cersei to grieve for Joffrey alone. Jaime arrives soon after and consoles Cersei. She asks him to kill Tyrion before a trial can take place, adamant that he is responsible. Jaime refuses and rapes Cersei next to Joffrey's corpse.<br><br>While engaging in an intercourse, Prince Oberyn and Ellaria Sand are interrupted by Tywin, who requests to speak with Oberyn privately. Tywin believes that Oberyn may have had a hand in Joffrey's murder. Oberyn refutes his claims and directly accuses Tywin of ordering Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane to rape and murder his sister, Elia years earlier. Tywin denies the accusations, but offers to have the Mountain speak with Oberyn about her murder, in exchange for Oberyn serving as one of the three judges in Tyrion's trial and also as a member of the small council. In his cell, Tyrion is visited by his squire, Podrick. Podrick tells Tyrion he is to be tried in a fortnight and that Sansa has not been seen since the wedding. Before leaving, Podrick tells Tyrion that he was asked to testify against Tyrion in exchange for a knighthood. Tyrion orders him to bring Jaime and then flee the city, as he fears for Podrick's life.<br><br>In the North<br><br>Samwell is teased by Ser Alliser and Janos Slynt, who do not believe he was able to kill a White Walker. Samwell speaks with Gilly about moving her to Mole's Town to keep her safe, as many of the Night's Watch brothers were arrested for rape. Gilly wants to stay at Castle Black, but is taken to Mole's Town where Samwell finds her temporary lodging.<br><br>The wildling party led by Tormund Giantsbane raids a small village, and Styr forces a small boy, Olly, to run to Castle Black to tell the Night's Watch what they have done. At a gathering, Ser Alliser tells the men that their duty is to protect the Wall first, which is echoed by Maester Aemon. When Alliser asks Jon, he reluctantly agrees that they must prioritize the Wall, before he is interrupted by a horn blast indicating returning rangers. Edd Tollett and Grenn arrive and inform them that Karl and his band of mutineers are living in Craster's Keep. Jon remembers his lie to Mance Rayder about having 1,000 men guarding the Wall, ten times their actual number, and says they must ride north and kill the mutineers before Mance finds out the truth about the Night's Watch forces and realizes how badly he has them outnumbered.<br><br>At Dragonstone<br><br>Stannis has Davos read a letter sent to Dragonstone, informing them that Joffrey is dead. Stannis claims it is the result of leeching Gendry's blood and burning the leeches. He chastises Davos for releasing Gendry, and for not having managed to raise an army for their cause. Davos suggests hiring mercenaries from Essos, but Stannis points out that they have no gold. Davos then visits Shireen, who continues to teach him to read. During the lesson, he suddenly comes up with an idea and has her write a message to the Iron Bank of Braavos in Stannis' name.<br><br>In the Riverlands<br><br>The Hound and Arya continue their journey east toward the Vale of Arryn, before accepting an offer of shelter from a farmer. At dinner, the Hound agrees to work for the farmer in exchange for some silver, but in the morning, he steals the farmer's silver despite Arya's protests.<br><br>Outside Meereen<br><br>Daenerys and her army arrive outside Meereen, where they are received by the Champion of Meereen. Ser Jorah informs her that she must send her own champion to battle the one from Meereen. Her advisors argue over the chance to fight for her, but Daario Naharis is selected. Daario easily kills the champion. Daenerys then speaks to the city's slaves, telling them of her victories in Astapor and Yunkai, including freeing those cities' slaves. She then orders her catapults to fire, and they launch barrels filled with broken slave collars into the city as a sign of the freedom she intends to bring them.</p></div></div>

He refers to his new but unspecified powerful allies, stating that Joffrey's death was a gift to them that will help their friendship "grow strong". He adds that, because he has no visible motive to kill Joffrey, he will not be suspected. Littlefinger informs Sansa that a missing stone in her necklace contained the poison used for the murder.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>At Castle Black, Ser Alliser Thorne orders Jon Snow to stop training other men, reminding Jon that he is officially a steward. Janos Slynt advises Thorne to send the now-popular Jon on an expedition to kill the mutineers at Craster's Keep in the hope that he will be killed before he can be elected the new Lord Commander.

At night, Grey Worm and other Unsullied infiltrate Meereen, arm the slaves, and incite a slave uprising that leaves Daenerys in control of the city the following morning. Although Ser Barristan Selmy advises Daenerys to show mercy, she orders 163 of the remaining masters crucified, as justice for the same number of slave children crucified along the road to Meereen.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>At Craster's Keep, the mutineers led by Karl Tanner are raping, eating and drinking their fill. Karl orders his henchman Rast to dispose of Craster's last child, a son, after Craster's wives ask that he be "given to the gods". Karl realizes that the child will be taken by the White Walkers, and that this is how Craster protected himself from them. He reasons that if they continue to uphold the bargain they too will be safe; Rast complies and abandons the infant in the woods. Nearby, Bran Stark and his companions hear the infant's cries. They are captured by the mutineers, and Bran is forced to admit his identity.<br><br>Later, a White Walker retrieves Craster's son. The Walker travels to the White Walkers' fortress in the Lands of Always Winter and lays the child on an altar made of ice.

In council with her father Tywin, Cersei decides that Tommen and Margaery will marry in a fortnight. They also make plans for Cersei's wedding to Loras Tyrell, and discuss how the gold mines in the Westerlands have run dry. Tywin tells Cersei that the crown is deeply indebted to the Iron Bank of Braavos, and that the union of the houses of Lannister and Tyrell will help rectify this problem. Cersei also tries to influence Tywin into declaring Tyrion guilty in his upcoming trial. In the gardens, Cersei speaks to Oberyn Martell about her daughter, Myrcella Baratheon. She asks him to take a ship back to Sunspear as a gift for Myrcella, which he agrees to do.<br><br>In the Vale<br><br>Lord Petyr Baelish and Sansa Stark arrive in the Vale of Arryn. At the Bloody Gate, he tells Ser Donnel Waynwood that Sansa's name is Alayne, hiding her true identity as she is still wanted in King's Landing for Joffrey's murder. Upon their arrival they are received by Lady Lysa Arryn and her son, Robin. Lysa is aware of Sansa's true identity, and has Robin show her to her chamber. When they have gone, Lysa expresses her desire to marry Petyr that day, and speaks of what she has done for him, including poisoning her previous husband, Lord Jon Arryn, and accusing the Lannisters in her letter to Catelyn. In order to quiet her, Petyr agrees to marry her as soon as possible. At night, Lysa and Sansa talk about Catelyn, and how Petyr loved her. Their conversation grows tense, with Lysa accusing Sansa of having seduced Petyr, but is eventually convinced by Sansa that she is a virgin and that Baelish feels little but contempt for Sansa. Lysa tells Sansa that once Tyrion Lannister has been executed, she will be married to Robin.<br><br>In Meereen<br><br>News of Joffrey's death reaches Daenerys Targaryen. At a meeting with her council, Daario Naharis announces that his forces have taken the Meereenese navy, and Daenerys expresses her desire to use the ships to invade Westeros. While her advisers are optimistic about her chances of seizing King's Landing, Ser Jorah Mormont warns her that may not be enough to conquer the Seven Kingdoms. He also informs Daenerys that both Astapor and Yunkai have fallen back into old habits, with Yunkai again being ruled by slavers and Astapor now being ruled by a self-declared "imperial majesty". After seeking advice from Jorah, she tells him that instead of sailing to Westeros, she intends to stay for now and rule Slaver's Bay as a queen.<br><br>On the Kingsroad<br><br>Brienne of Tarth and her squire, Podrick Payne, ride toward the Wall, believing they may find Sansa there with Jon Snow. At camp, Brienne scolds Podrick for not knowing how to cook or do a squire's proper duties. When asked what he did for Tyrion, Podrick tells her that he once killed a knight of the Kingsguard to protect Tyrion during the Battle of the Blackwater. Impressed, Brienne finally relents by letting Podrick assist her with her armor.<br><br>In the Riverlands<br><br>Arya and Sandor "The Hound" Clegane discuss her ritualistic reciting of the names of people she intends to kill and Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane's appearance on the list. Arya reveals that the Hound's name is on her list as well. In the morning, the Hound finds Arya training with her sword. He insults her swordplay and the man who taught it to her, Syrio Forel, expressing incredulity that Forel was killed by a fighter as weak as Ser Meryn Trant. The Hound challenges Arya to demonstrate her abilities by attacking him, but his armor easily repels her jab and he knocks her to the ground, telling her that her fighting style is useless against armored opponents.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>Locke scouts Craster's Keep, and witnesses Rast beating one of Craster's former wives. When he sneaks inside the encampment, he sees Bran Stark and his group held captive in a small hut. When Locke returns to the group led by Jon Snow, he counsels that they should strike soon, as the mutineers are drunk. However, he lies that the hut where Bran is imprisoned contains dogs which will give the alarm if the group ventures too close. Jon informs his group that they will attack the Keep at sundown.<br><br>Later, Karl Tanner enters the hut and attempts to rape Meera Reed, but Jojen Reed stalls him by revealing his greenseeing abilities and taunting Karl that he has foreseen Karl's body burning. Shouting outside draws Karl away as Jon's group arrives to attack the mutineers. A battle ensues in which several mutineers are killed. Locke slips away from the fight unnoticed to see to Bran and his friends. He cuts Bran's ties and his leg, appearing threatening as he picks him up to take him away; Bran uses his warg abilities to enter Hodor's mind and have Hodor pull free of his chains as Locke carries him outside. Bran, now using Hodor's body, chases down Locke and kills him by snapping his neck. He then returns to his own body and instructs Hodor to free Jojen and Meera, as well as the captive direwolves. Though Bran wishes to reunite with Jon, Jojen tells him that Jon will try to stop his journey north, and the group departs the encampment unseen.<br><br>Jon enters the Keep and fights Karl. Though Karl nearly kills Jon due to his dirty fighting style, he is distracted by one of Craster's widows stabbing him in the back. Turning to kill her, Karl is suddenly killed himself as Jon shoves his sword through the back of Karl's head and out his mouth. While counting the dead, Edd notices that Rast is missing. Rast has fled through the woods, but is killed by Jon's direwolf Ghost before the latter returns to his master. Jon asks Craster's wives to come to the Wall, but they decline his offer, due to their mistrust of the Night's Watch. Jon and the Night's Watch then burn Craster's Keep and the bodies of the dead, ensuring that they can't be resurrected as wights.</p></div></div>

Tycho declines Stannis's request for financial aid, naming his lack of a large army or the food necessary to sustain them as his reasons. Before leaving, Davos makes an impassioned speech about Stannis's merits, pointing out his being a man of action, his prime age, and his ability on battlefield, while also pointing out Tywin Lannister's age and his weak potential successors. Davos is successful in winning over Tycho, and is granted the funds he needs. He later informs the pirate Salladhor Saan that Stannis finally has the money Salladhor was promised in exchange for Salladhor's service, and that they will set sail together the next day.<br><br>In Meereen<br><br>Near Meereen, one of Daenerys's dragons, Drogon, attacks a group of goats led by a farmer and his son. While she receives supplicants, the farmer presents a bag of charred goat bones to Daenerys and her advisors, and she promises to pay him three times their worth. After he departs, Hizdahr zo Loraq requests the right to bury the remains of his father, who was one of the Meereenese masters crucified on Daenerys's orders. Loraq also points out that his father was one of the masters who was against the crucifixion of the slave children, but was killed due to Daenerys's "justice". Daenerys reluctantly grants his request.<br><br>At the Dreadfort<br><br>Yara Greyjoy leads her Ironborn soldiers in a raid on the Dreadfort to rescue Theon. Yara finds Theon locked in the kennels with the dogs but he is reluctant to accept her help, believing she has been sent by Ramsay to trick him. He also refuses to acknowledge his true name, instead telling Yara that he is Reek. Before they can flee, Ramsay and his men corner the Ironborn and afterwards release his hounds on the invaders. Upon returning to their rowboats, Yara tells her men that Theon is dead. In the morning, Ramsay rewards Reek with a bath. Ramsay tells Reek that he requires his assistance in taking Moat Cailin, and that, in order to comply with his father's command, he will need Reek to play the role of "someone [he is] not": Theon Greyjoy.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>At a meeting of the Small Council, Tywin announces that Tyrion's trial will begin that afternoon. Lord Varys informs Tywin that Sandor "The Hound" Clegane has been spotted in the Riverlands, and Tywin orders a bounty on his head. Varys also informs the council of Daenerys' conquest of Meereen, and Tywin decides to take measures to prevent her from launching an invasion.<br><br>In the dungeon, Jaime reluctantly has Tyrion shackled and brought into the throne room by order of Tywin, to begin his trial for regicide. King Tommen recuses himself from the trial, appointing his grandfather Tywin, Prince Oberyn Martell, and Lord Mace Tyrell as judges. Several witnesses are called for the prosecution, including Ser Meryn Trant, Grand Maester Pycelle, Queen Regent Cersei, and Varys, all of whom give testimony backing the accusations against Tyrion, with wildly varying degrees of truthfulness, but all conveniently omitting Joffrey's actions. At recess, Jaime asks Tywin to spare Tyrion, offering to leave the Kingsguard and return to Casterly Rock, to be Tywin's heir. Tywin accepts immediately, telling Jaime that Tyrion will be allowed to join the Night's Watch after being found guilty of Joffrey's murder, provided he pleads for mercy.<br><br>Returning to the trial, Tywin orders the next witness to testify: Shae. She falsely testifies that Tyrion and Sansa planned Joffrey's murder together, claiming that Sansa wanted vengeance for the murder of her father, mother, and brother. She tells the judges of Tyrion's sexual desires, embarrassing him in front of the court. Before she can continue, Tyrion's anger finally boils over, and he announces that he wishes to "confess". He first lashes out at the people of King's Landing in attendance for their ingratitude after he had saved them from Stannis Baratheon's attack on Blackwater Bay, declaring he should have simply allowed Stannis to kill them all. Facing Tywin and Cersei, Tyrion denies having killed Joffrey, but admits that he wishes he had, and accuses his father of putting him on trial because of his dwarfism. He finishes by saying that he refuses to be sentenced for a crime he did not commit and that the gods will decide his fate, demanding a trial by combat.</p></div></div>

Tyrion angrily counters they both know that deal was Tywin's plan all along, and it felt good to take that from him. Tyrion asks Jaime to be his champion, but Jaime declines due to his poor performance with his left hand. Tyrion then asks Jaime to locate Bronn, and asks who their sister Cersei has named as champion. Her champion turns out to be Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane, whom Cersei greets while he executes several prisoners. Days later, Bronn visits Tyrion and informs him that Cersei offered to wed him to Lollys Stokeworth, a highborn lady with good prospects of a rich inheritance, and admits his own fear of the Mountain's fighting prowess. He states that he will not face the Mountain on Tyrion's behalf. Though Tyrion believes himself dead already, they part as friends.<br><br>At night, Oberyn Martell visits Tyrion and recounts that he visited Tyrion in his infancy and has long been aware of his sister's antagonism towards him. A broken Tyrion admits that Cersei "always gets what she wants", to which Oberyn counters that she cannot give him what he wants; vengeance for the murder of his sister, Elia, and her children. He then announces he intends to commence his revenge by championing Tyrion's cause in the ring, thus giving him the perfect chance to confront and kill Ser Gregor.<br><br>At Castle Black<br><br>Jon Snow and his remaining men return to Castle Black.

When Brienne inquires about Sansa Stark, Hot Pie nervously ends their conversation. The following morning, Hot Pie approaches them in private and tells them about his journey with Arya Stark, who was believed to be dead, having not been seen since her father's execution. Hot Pie tells them that the Brotherhood Without Banners took her and planned to ransom her. Podrick informs Brienne that Lysa Arryn is Sansa and Arya's last living relative with money, and since Riverrun is now ruled by Walder Frey, who betrayed and murdered the Starks at the Red Wedding massacre, they decide to head for the Vale.<br><br>In the Riverlands<br><br>Arya and Sandor "The Hound" Clegane continue their journey east. Along the way, they come upon a badly wounded man, whom the Hound kills out of mercy. Immediately after, they are attacked by Biter and Rorge. Biter bites the Hound's neck, and the Hound kills him. The Hound believes that the outlaws are trying to kill him because he insulted King Joffrey Baratheon, but Rorge explains that Joffrey was poisoned at his wedding and that the bounty on the Hound's head is for killing Lannister soldiers. Arya recalls that Rorge had previously threatened to rape her, and, after learning his name, stabs him in the heart. Later, while the Hound tries to stitch his neck wound, Arya offers to cauterize the wound, but the Hound refuses due to his pyrophobia. He recounts how his brother Gregor caused his facial burns by pressing him into a fire, and she assists him in stitching the bite.<br><br>In Meereen<br><br>Daenerys Targaryen finds Daario Naharis in her quarters. He requests that she make use of his talents in either war or women, to which she responds by ordering him to take off his clothes. In the morning, Ser Jorah Mormont encounters Daario as he leaves Daenerys's chambers, and counsels her on whether it is wise to trust Daario, who betrayed and killed the other captains of the Second Sons. Daenerys tells Jorah that she has ordered Daario and his army to retake Yunkai, and kill all remaining masters there. Jorah notes that, had Ned Stark taken the same approach toward him when he sold slaves, he would not be there to advise her. She relents, and orders Jorah to tell Daario to take Hizdahr zo Loraq with him, to advise the masters of Yunkai in conforming to her rule.<br><br>At the Eyrie<br><br>When snow begins to fall in the Eyrie, Sansa builds a snow replica of Winterfell. Robin Arryn arrives and tells Sansa that when they get married, they will be able to kill anyone who bothers them with the Moon Door. He tries to make a Moon Door in the replica of Winterfell but accidentally destroys one of the towers, and when Sansa criticises him he responds by throwing a tantrum and destroying the replica, prompting her to slap him. Shortly afterward, Petyr Baelish arrives and discusses his true motives with Sansa, telling her that he greatly loved her mother, Catelyn, and the reason he had Joffrey killed was to avenge her. Petyr then kisses Sansa, but before she pulls away from him, Lysa Arryn sees them. She later summons Sansa and confronts her near the Moon Door. Lysa grabs Sansa, and pushes her down to her knees near the opening of the door, telling her that all her enemies have gone through it. Petyr arrives and tells Lysa to release her, promising to send Sansa away. Lysa releases Sansa, and Petyr goes to her, but he admits that he only ever truly loved Catelyn, and pushes Lysa through the Moon Door to her death.</p></div></div>

However, after the Ironborn open the Moat's gates, Ramsay and his army flay and slaughter them. As a reward for retaking the Moat, Lord Roose Bolton legitimizes Ramsay as a true Bolton.

Petyr claims that Lysa committed suicide by jumping through the Moon Door, but they do not trust him, citing his brothels in King's Landing and his foreign blood. Royce demands to speak with Sansa, who is acting as Petyr's niece, Alayne. Sansa appears to crumble under the pressure of the situation, admitting her true identity to the group, but eventually corroborates Petyr's story, and convinces them of his innocence. As Petyr walks the group out of the Eyrie, he makes plans to have Robin tour the Vale. When Petyr confronts Sansa about her lie to the Lords of the Vale, she tells him that she doesn't know what they would do with her if they executed him for Lysa's death. She also tells Petyr that she knows what he wants. Later, Petyr, Sansa and Robin leave the Eyrie to tour the Vale, with Sansa having dyed her hair black and adopted a new, darker wardrobe to hide her identity.<br><br>Meanwhile, Sandor "The Hound" Clegane and Arya walk the narrow path toward the Eyrie. Coming to the Bloody Gate, they are informed of Lady Arryn's death by Donnel Waynwood. Arya, rather than mourn the loss of her aunt, breaks into hysterical laughter at the irony of their situation.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Shortly before his trial by combat is to begin, Tyrion discusses his chances with his brother, Jaime. When Tyrion is taken outside, he has a brief conversation with his champion, Oberyn, who is confident. Ser Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane arrives shortly thereafter, and the trial commences. During the fight, Oberyn demands the Mountain admit to raping and murdering his sister, Elia, and her two children. Oberyn lands several skillful attacks on the Mountain, seemingly toying with the much larger man. He knocks the Mountain to the ground and lands a near-fatal blow. Oberyn then screams at the Mountain to confess, hoping the Mountain will admit that it was Tywin who gave the order. As Oberyn circles him, he lets his guard down and the Mountain knocks him to the ground, then gouges out his eyes while confessing to the murder of Elia and her children, and subsequently crushes Oberyn's skull with his hands, killing him instantly. The Mountain then collapses to the ground from his wounds. Tywin rises and sentences Tyrion to death for regicide.</p></div></div>

In the library of Castle Black, Sam and Maester Aemon discuss Gilly, who soon after arrives at Castle Black, having been spared by Ygritte during the raid of Mole's Town. Their reunion is cut short by horn blasts signaling that Mance Rayder's army has arrived.

On top of the Wall, Janos Slynt proves to be inept as a commander, so Grenn tricks him to go down to the castle, leaving Jon in charge. Several giants and a woolly mammoth attempt to pull down the large gate at the base of the Wall, and Jon sends Grenn with five men to defend the passage. At the castle, Ser Alliser is wounded by Tormund Giantsbane and is taken to be treated. Sam and Pyp use crossbows to shoot at the wildlings, but Pyp is shot through the neck by Ygritte.

Jon battles with Styr, and after taking a severe beating, is able to kill the Thenn. Ygritte confronts him but hesitates with her arrow, as they both smile at each other. Her pause allows Olly to shoot her in the back, and as they reminisce on how they should have stayed in the cave together, she dies in Jon's arms.

Daenerys reluctantly grants his request, allowing him to form a contract with his former master that can last no longer than a year. The next citizen in line brings her the charred remains of his daughter, who was killed by Drogon, one of her dragons. While Drogon has not returned, she tearfully chains her two other dragons, Rhaegal and Viserion, away in the catacombs as a precaution.<br><br>Beyond the Wall<br><br>Jon Snow meets with the King-beyond-the-Wall Mance Rayder, ostensibly to discuss an end to their conflict, although Jon actually plans to assassinate him. Though Mance eventually sees through Jon's ruse and nearly kills him, their negotiations are cut short when they hear a horn blast, and a massive cavalry charge led by King Stannis Baratheon and Ser Davos Seaworth overruns the wildling encampment. Mance surrenders to Stannis, and though Stannis thinks to kill him, Jon suggests taking him captive instead, as Mance once showed him similar mercy. After holding a funeral for the deceased brothers, Jon burns Ygritte's remains north of the Wall, following Tormund Giantsbane's request.<br><br>Further north, Bran Stark and his companions reach their destination: the large Heart Tree seen in Jojen Reed's vision. Upon approaching the tree, they are set upon by a group of undead. Though Jojen is killed in the attack, Bran, Hodor, and Meera Reed are saved by a Child of the Forest. The child takes the group into the cave under the Heart Tree to meet an old man sitting amongst tree roots, who tells Bran that while he will never be able to walk again, he will be able to fly.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane lies dying from Prince Oberyn Martell's poisoned spear. Qyburn believes that he can save Clegane, while Grand Maester Pycelle disagrees. Despite Pycelle's protests, Cersei Lannister ousts him from his laboratory and gives Clegane's care over to Qyburn who cautions Cersei that, while he may be able to save Clegane, the procedure may "change" him. He assures her, however, that his procedure will not weaken Gregor.<br><br>Afterwards, Cersei tells her father, Tywin, that if forced to marry Loras Tyrell, she will admit her incestuous relationship with Jaime, and that her children are the issue of such. She leaves an outraged Tywin to meet Jaime in the Kingsguard's quarters, where she professes her love for him, and the two rekindle their relationship.<br><br>In the dungeons, Tyrion Lannister awaits his execution, but Jaime appears and helps him escape. They say their farewells in an underground tunnel, but Tyrion instead uses a small hidden passage to sneak into the Tower of the Hand. He finds Shae in his father Tywin's bed. Shae, who had falsely testified against Tyrion at his trial, initially thinks this is Tywin and addresses him as 'my lion', as she had previously done for Tyrion. She then attacks him with a knife, but Tyrion manages to strangle her to death.<br><br>Tyrion then readies Joffrey's crossbow and confronts Tywin on the privy and confesses that he had loved Shae. Tywin does not believe that Tyrion would actually shoot him. He tries to negotiate, but twice dismisses Shae as a whore, despite Tyrion's warning the first time.

They happen across Arya Stark and the Hound, Sandor Clegane. After Podrick recognises the Hound, Brienne deduces Arya's identity and tells her of her oath to her mother, Catelyn Stark. The Hound is unconvinced of her loyalties, pointing out her Lannister sword, and the matter quickly comes to blows. After a brutal brawl, Brienne knocks the Hound off a cliff, and unsuccessfully searches for Arya. After they leave, Arya emerges from hiding and finds the Hound grievously injured. Though he begs her for death, she instead takes his money and leaves him, presumably to die. Traveling by horse to a harbor, she attempts to buy passage north, only to be told the ship is bound for Essos. Upon hearing that the captain is travelling home to Braavos, she chooses to travel there, paying with the coin Jaqen H'ghar gave her .</p></div></div>

Cersei denies any knowledge of her husband's murder, and leaves.<br><br>Margaery Tyrell walks in on her brother, Loras, and his lover, Olyvar, naked in bed. After dismissing Olyvar, she tells Loras that he should be more discreet but he dismisses this idea by saying that they already know about him and that he is unlikely to be married to Cersei as Tywin's death means no one can force her to do anything. He calls this bad news for Margaery as it means that Cersei will remain in King's Landing instead of going to Highgarden with him. Margaery hints that she may have a solution.<br><br>In Pentos<br><br>Tyrion, weary and drunk, is broken out of the crate in which he was smuggled out of Westeros by Varys. Arriving in Pentos, Varys tells Tyrion that he and Illyrio Mopatis had worked together in secret to install Daenerys Targaryen as the new ruler of Westeros, and convinces Tyrion to travel with him to Meereen to meet her.<br><br>In Meereen<br><br>Several Unsullied remove the large gold harpy from the top of the Great Pyramid in Meereen. Later, one of the Unsullied is murdered in a brothel by a member of the Sons of the Harpy, a resistance group operating in Meereen.

In exchange, the Wise Masters have asked that Daenerys consent to the reopening of the fighting pits, an arena where slaves used to fight to the death. Daenerys denies the request. Later, Daario urges her to reconsider, as his youth spent fighting in the pits gave him the combat skills necessary for him to join the Second Sons, where he met Daenerys.<br><br>After a comment made by Daario, Daenerys visits her two captive dragons, Viserion and Rhaegal, which she locked underground to prevent them from killing people.

Though Baelish told Lord Royce that they would be travelling to the Fingers, Baelish and Sansa instead head west, with Baelish explaining that he is taking her to a place where the Lannisters can never find her.<br><br>Podrick Payne attempts to plan the next move for Brienne of Tarth and himself, but Brienne tells him that she doesn't want anyone following her.

He travels to meet with Bronn, who has gone to Castle Stokeworth with Lollys, his fiancée. Jaime gives Bronn a letter telling him that he will not be wed to Lollys. When Bronn reminds him of the deal he had with Cersei, Jaime tells him that, should he agree to help rescue Myrcella, he will instead be wed to a woman of higher standing, with a larger castle.<br><br>Cersei meets with two hunters who have brought her a severed head, though she is disappointed to find that it is not Tyrion's head. Qyburn lays claim to the head for his research and the two walk to a small council meeting. With the office of Hand of the King vacant, Cersei tells the council that she will stand in temporarily until Tommen chooses a new Hand. She appoints Mace Tyrell as the new Master of Coin and Qyburn as the new Master of Whisperers. When Cersei tries to appoint her uncle Kevan as the Master of War, he declines, telling her that as the queen mother she holds no power, and he has no interest in serving in a council filled with her sycophants. In defiance of Cersei's "orders", Kevan states that he will return to Casterly Rock until he hears direct word from Tommen that he is required.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>In the library, Gilly is tutored in reading by Shireen Baratheon before her mother Selyse orders her to stop. Jon is chastised by Stannis for giving Mance Rayder a merciful death.

Ser Davos tells Jon that the Night's Watch will elect a new Lord Commander that night, and that it is almost assured that Ser Alliser will win. Stannis asks Jon to kneel before him and pledge his life to him, and in exchange he will legitimize Jon, making him Jon Stark and giving him Winterfell.<br><br>In the great hall, Jon tells Sam that he will refuse Stannis's offer, as he swore an oath to the Night's Watch. After Maester Aemon asks for discussion about possible candidates, Janos Slynt advises his brothers to vote for Ser Alliser, saying he is the only true choice. Another man tells the brothers to vote for Denys Mallister. Before the voting can begin, Sam gives a speech imploring his brothers to vote for Jon, reminding them all how he led the mission to Craster's Keep to avenge Commander Mormont's death and how he led the defense of Castle Black. After the voting is complete, the ballots are tallied and show a tie between Jon and Ser Alliser. Maester Aemon casts the deciding vote in favor of Jon, making him the new Lord Commander of the Night's Watch.<br><br>In the Vale<br><br>Brienne and Podrick stop at an inn.

She is turned away by the door-keeper, even though she displays Jaqen H'ghar's iron coin. She spends several nights sitting in front of the House. Later, while she is defending herself from a group of thieves, the door-keeper appears, causing the thieves to flee.

When she asks to take revenge on Myrcella, Doran rebuffs her, and she leaves, subtly warning Doran that he will not be in power forever.<br><br>In the Flatlands<br><br>Tyrion and Varys travel through the Flatlands outside Pentos on their way to Volantis.

Margaery then manipulates Tommen into trying to persuade his mother, Cersei, to return to Casterly Rock for her wellbeing, but she declines. Cersei, with the façade of a caring mother-in-law, confronts Margaery and is powerless when she mockingly gossips about Tommen's enthusiasm in the bedroom and Cersei's age.<br><br>In a whorehouse, the High Septon is attacked by Lancel and several other Sparrows, and forced to walk naked through the streets while they call him a sinner. He requests that the Small Council take action against the Sparrows by executing their leader, the High Sparrow. Cersei meets with the High Sparrow personally to tell him that he will not be executed, and that she has imprisoned the High Septon, whom the High Sparrow will replace as head of the Faith. Returning to the castle, Cersei has Qyburn send a message to Lord Baelish. As Qyburn writes, the body of Gregor "The Mountain" Clegane shakes on Qyburn's operating table.<br><br>In the North<br><br>Reek passes through the courtyard at Winterfell, while several workers repair the castle. He is horrified to witness several flayed corpses being hung up in the courtyard. While serving dinner to Roose and Ramsay Bolton, Reek overhears that the Boltons do not have enough men to hold the North, should the former bannermen of House Stark rise against them. Roose tells Ramsay that the best way for them to forge alliances is with a marriage.<br><br>At Moat Cailin, Petyr Baelish tells Sansa that he has agreed to have her wed to Ramsay. She is disgusted by the idea, since Roose was responsible for the death of her brother and mother, but changes her mind when Petyr points out that this will be an opportunity to take revenge. They arrive at Winterfell and are received by Roose, his wife Walda, and Ramsay. Ramsay promises Petyr that he will never hurt Sansa, before Roose arrives to discuss the possible ramifications of their plan. Petyr tells him that, with Tywin Lannister dead and Margaery Tyrell as queen, they have no reason to fear the Lannisters. Roose is unconvinced, and shows him the letter sent for Baelish from Cersei. Petyr reassures him of their alliance, but Roose requests to read Baelish's reply nonetheless.<br><br>Petyr and Sansa are being secretly followed by Brienne and Podrick. Podrick tells Brienne the story of how he came to serve Tyrion Lannister, and Brienne tells him of how she came to be devoted to Renly Baratheon, when he showed her kindness when they were young. She then explains that she believes Stannis Baratheon was responsible for Renly's death, and that she has sworn to kill Stannis in revenge.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>Jon, now the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch, refuses Stannis's offer to legitimize him in return for helping Stannis take back the North. Stannis tells Jon that his army will leave the Wall within a fortnight to march on Winterfell. In the dining hall, Jon appoints Ser Alliser as First Ranger. He also appoints Janos Slynt as the commander of Greyguard, a ruined castle which Slynt must restore. Slynt refuses and insults Jon, who responds by having Slynt seized and taken outside. Despite his pleas for mercy, Jon personally beheads Slynt. Stannis, who was watching, nods in approval.<br><br>In Braavos<br><br>Arya watches as the man with Jaqen H'ghar's face helps a man drink from a pool of water. He leaves to pray, and Arya approaches Jaqen, demanding that he begin teaching her to be a Faceless Man. Jaqen reminds her of the phrase "valar dohaeris", which means "all men must serve", and accuses Arya of only wanting to serve herself. She turns and sees that the praying man has died, revealing that the pool of water is poison for those who seek a quick death. Two servants then come to take his body away, but ignore Arya when she asks what they are doing with the body.<br><br>Later, Arya is approached by the Waif, who asks her who she is. Arya replies that she is no one, but the Waif is dissatisfied with her answer and begins to beat her. Jaqen arrives and stops the fight, but, noticing that Arya was about to attack the Waif with Needle, asks Arya how she came to be surrounded by things owned by Arya Stark if she is indeed no one. Arya then takes her possessions to a dock, where she throws them into the water. She cannot bring herself to discard Needle, so she hides it amongst some nearby rocks, and returns to sweeping at the House of Black and White. Jaqen then takes her to a room where she and the Waif wash a dead man's body.<br><br>In Volantis<br><br>Arriving in Volantis, Tyrion persuades Varys to let him depart their carriage and walk the streets. In the city, they witness a red priestess preach to a congregation of slaves about "the savior", Daenerys Targaryen. After the priestess notices Tyrion, the two hide in a brothel.

She then leaves to meet with the High Sparrow, authorizing the revival of the Faith Militant, an armed force in service to the faith of the seven, causing an attack on one of Petyr Baelish's brothels, and the arrest of Ser Loras Tyrell because of his homosexuality. News of his arrest reaches Margaery, who asks Tommen to order his release. Tommen first appeals to his mother for Loras's release, but she tells him that he must speak with the High Sparrow. He tries to speak with the High Sparrow, but the Faith Militant prevent him from disturbing his prayers, prompting one of the Kingsguard to inform Tommen that they will kill the Faith Militant if he orders them to do so. Tommen is visibly unnerved at the prospect of shedding blood on the steps of the Sept of Baelor despite his desire to please Margaery. When some street urchins start yelling insults at him about his incestuous parentage, Tommen quickly realizes they are outnumbered and tactfully orders his Kingsguard not to attack the Faith Militant, saying they will find another way to free Loras. Frustrated with Tommen's inaction, Margaery leaves to inform her grandmother Olenna of the situation.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>After assisting in training his men, Jon signs several letters to be sent to northern lords, including Roose Bolton, pleading that they send men and supplies to help defend the Wall, which is extremely undermanned with only 50 Night's Watch men remaining at Castle Black. Jon is reluctant to plead to the Boltons for aid, but must respect the Nights Watch's neutrality. Melisandre arrives to ask Jon to join Stannis in taking Winterfell from the Boltons, but he again declines. She attempts to seduce him, but he is able to resist her advances, telling Melisandre that he still loves Ygritte. Before leaving, she says "You know nothing, Jon Snow", mimicking Ygritte. Elsewhere in Castle Black, Stannis tells his daughter, Shireen, the story of how she became afflicted with greyscale, and how he did everything in his power to cure her.<br><br>At Winterfell<br><br>In the crypts, Sansa lights candles for her deceased family members. Petyr arrives, and tells her about her aunt, Lyanna, and how Robert's Rebellion started when Rhaegar Targaryen allegedly kidnapped her. He informs Sansa that he is leaving Winterfell to return to King's Landing, at Cersei's request. Petyr also tells Sansa that Stannis and his army are at Castle Black, and suggests that they will soon take Winterfell from the Boltons, whom they outnumber. As they believe that all of her siblings are dead, Petyr believes that Stannis will appoint Sansa as Wardeness of the North. Sansa asks him what if Stannis does not overthrow the Boltons, and Littlefinger states that in that case she will learn to control Ramsay Bolton.<br><br>In Dorne<br><br>Jaime and Bronn arrive in Dorne, with the intention of rescuing Myrcella Baratheon. Bronn wonders why Jaime is so adamant about personally participating in the rescue, and Jaime implies that he seeks redemption for indirectly causing his father Tywin's death and claims that he will personally kill his brother Tyrion if he ever sees him again. Shortly after landing they are discovered by four Dornish guards, who recognise the duo as being from King's Landing. Jaime and Bronn are forced to kill the guards after being ordered to disarm. In doing so, Jaime learns how to use his metal hand to his advantage.<br><br>Elsewhere, Ellaria Sand meets with Oberyn's three bastard daughters: Obara, Nymeria, and Ellaria's daughter Tyene, collectively known as the Sand Snakes.

She asks them to join her in starting a war with the Lannisters, and they agree.<br><br>On the Summer Sea<br><br>At night, Jorah Mormont attacks a fisherman and steals his boat. He takes the captive Tyrion and sets sail. In the morning, Tyrion deduces Jorah's identity, and learns that he is being taken to Daenerys, not his sister Cersei.

A patrol of Unsullied, led by Grey Worm, respond to the panic, but are ambushed by more Sons of the Harpy. In the ensuing battle, a majority of the Unsullied are slaughtered and Grey Worm is injured before Ser Barristan arrives to assist him. Though Barristan slays many of the Sons of the Harpy, they start to overwhelm him and he is stabbed multiple times.

Annoyed by Ramsay's petty cruelty, Roose announces that he and Walda are expecting a child.

Aemon laments that he is Daenerys's only remaining relative, and that he is too old and sickly to help her. Jon arrives and speaks privately to Aemon, asking his advice with regards to gaining the wildlings as allies. Aemon tells Jon that he must "kill the boy and let the man be born," indicating that as Lord Commander, Jon must do what he feels is right.<br><br>Afterward, Jon meets with Tormund Giantsbane and frees him. He offers to allow the wildlings to settle south of the wall, in return for an alliance with the Night's Watch. Tormund tells Jon that most of the wildlings have made their way to a settlement called Hardhome, and that in order to unite them and forge an alliance, Jon must accompany him to speak with them himself. When Jon presents his plan to his men, they reject it, citing the numerous brothers and innocents killed by the wildlings, including Jon's friends Grenn and Pyp, and Olly's entire village. Regardless, Jon decides to go forward with the plan.<br><br>In the library, Sam tells Gilly about how he had always wanted to become a Maester before joining the Night's Watch. Stannis then enters and asks Sam about dragonglass, which is capable of killing White Walkers. He mentions that Dragonstone has large supplies of dragonglass, and that Sam should continue researching the White Walkers' weaknesses. Later, Stannis tells Ser Davos that they will march toward Winterfell in the morning.

However, Ser Barristan Selmy has succumbed to his wounds. Daenerys and Daario mourn Barristan in the Great Pyramid, and Daenerys orders the leaders of the great families of Meereen to be brought before her, including Hizdahr zo Loraq. She has her dragons Viserion and Rhaegal burn and eat one of the leaders, and imprisons the others. Three days later, Grey Worm awakens and tells Missandei how he felt fear that he would never see her again; the two share a passionate kiss.

The Waif hints that in order to pass, she must be able to convincingly lie. When Jaqen H'ghar comes to test Arya again, she tells him how she came to join the Faceless Men, but lies about several key facts. Jaqen is able to tell when Arya is lying, including when Arya claims that she hated Sandor Clegane.

Petyr then meets with Cersei, who has started to question where his loyalties lie. He assures her that he is loyal to the throne, and informs her that Sansa is alive in Winterfell and is set to marry Ramsay Bolton. Cersei is infuriated at the Boltons' apparent treachery, but Petyr convinces her that he has already set up a plan to deal with the situation.

At Loras' holy inquest, the High Sparrow interrogates both Loras and Margaery Tyrell, and they both deny that Loras is homosexual. Olyvar is then brought in and testifies against Loras, citing a unique birthmark that Loras has, and also noting that Margaery had seen them in bed together. After Loras, enraged, attempts to attack Olyvar, the High Sparrow is convinced that there is enough evidence to proceed with Loras' trial.

Olenna first tries to bribe him but upon seeing that he cannot be bought, threatens to end the Tyrell support for the capital by stopping shipments of food. The High Sparrow, however, remains unfazed. He counters that she and the rest of the nobility are outnumbered by the smallfolk, and tells her to consider what will come when the smallfolk stop fearing the nobility.

Tyrion also convinces Daenerys to spare Jorah's life, though he tells her that Jorah should not be allowed to serve her, and she orders Jorah exiled from Meereen again. Later, Daenerys tells Tyrion that she will not have him killed or exiled, and intends to allow him to advise her. She also tells him about reclaiming the Iron Throne, her birthright. When she claims that the common people of Westeros will support her claim, Tyrion points out that her rule of Meereen has not gone smoothly with only the support of the common people, and tells her that she will not succeed without the backing of a powerful Westerosi house. She compares the powerful houses of Westeros to spokes on a wheel and says that she intends to "break the wheel".<br><br>Meanwhile, Jorah returns to Yezzan zo Qaggaz and asks that he be allowed to fight in front of Daenerys in the fighting pits.<br><br>At Hardhome<br><br>Arriving at Hardhome, Jon, Tormund, and a group of Night's Watch brothers meet with the Lord of Bones, who has become the de facto leader of the wildlings.

At the meeting, Jon shares the dragonglass with the wildlings, telling them how Sam killed a White Walker with a dragonglass dagger. Jon offers to allow the wildlings to farm the lands south of the Wall if they will aid the Night's Watch in the coming war against the White Walkers. When asked what became of Mance Rayder, Jon admits that he killed him. Outraged, the assembled wildlings move to kill Jon, but Tormund is able to calm them by explaining that Jon killed Mance out of mercy.

Ramsay Bolton deduces that Sansa would have gone to Castle Black where, as the Lord Commander of the Night's Watch and her brother, Jon would offer both her and Theon his protection. Ramsay proposes to Roose Bolton that they storm the castle from the unprotected southern side. Roose warns Ramsay that these actions would turn the entire North against them.

He then lures Walda and his baby half-brother into the kennels, where he has them mauled to death by his hounds.<br><br>Sansa learns from Brienne of Tarth that Arya is alive, but that she hasn't been seen since her disappearance in the Riverlands. Theon then tells Sansa that he cannot accompany her to Castle Black, as he still fears retribution from Jon and does not deserve her or Jon's forgiveness.

After one particular defeat, Arya is surprised when Jaqen H'ghar who she has not encountered for a while, appears and attempts to tempt her with food, bedding, and the return of her vision.

He witnesses a vision of a young Eddard Stark, Benjen, and Lyanna Stark training together in Winterfell, and also learns Hodor's real name, Wylis. However, the Three-eyed Raven pulls Bran out of the memory, warning him that he risks "drowning" in old memories.

Yara points out that the armies of the North have retaken all of the Ironborn strongholds on the mainland, and pleads with him to end the war. However, Balon refuses and vows to send more troops to stage another invasion of the North. As Balon heads outside, he encounters his brother, Euron Greyjoy, who has come to overthrow him. Balon attempts to stab Euron, who throws him off a bridge to his death.

Bran remarks that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best swordsman his father ever saw.<br><br>Eddard says Prince Rhaegar Targaryen and the Mad King have been killed and asks why Ser Arthur was not present at the Battle of the Trident. Ser Arthur replies that he has been ordered to stay at the tower. After Eddard demands to know where his sister is, a battle ensues. Eddard is able to defeat Ser Gerold, but Ser Arthur - wielding dual swords - easily defeats most of Eddard's men by himself. As Eddard and Ser Arthur duel one-on-one, Bran is puzzled by this vision, as his father had repeatedly boasted of his defeat of Ser Arthur. It is quite apparent that his father is no match for the superior swordsman. Just as Ser Arthur is about to defeat and kill Eddard, a wounded Howland rises and plunges his dagger through the back of Ser Arthur's neck, before Eddard delivers the fatal blow, leaving Bran shocked.<br><br>When a woman's scream emerges from the tower, Ned and Howland begin to run inside. The Three-Eyed Raven begins to end the vision, explaining the rest is intended for another time, but Bran demands to stay and calls out to Ned. Ned turns for a second, seemingly having heard Bran's voice, but eventually continues inside, before the Three-Eyed Raven pulls Bran out of the vision. Back in the cave, Bran demands to know what was in the tower. The Three-Eyed Raven does not attend Bran's demands, saying he will eventually have to leave the cave but first must learn "everything."<br><br>In Vaes Dothrak<br><br>Daenerys Targaryen arrives with Khal Moro's khalasar at Vaes Dothrak, and is escorted to meet with the Dosh Khaleen by Moro's bloodriders. The elder of the Dosh Khaleen tries to sympathize with Daenerys, saying she was once married to a great khal with whom she thought she would rule the world but met the same fate. After giving Daenerys a change of clothes, she explains that the various khalasar have gathered at Vaes Dothrak to discuss which cities and towns to conquer.

He accuses her of conspiring to kill the Unsullied and Second Sons, but she replies by calling them foreign invaders. Varys tries to explain his perspective and mentions her son, Dom. Vala explains that if she gives him information on the Sons of the Harpy they will likely kill her. Varys offers her safe passage to Pentos with a bag of silver for information.<br><br>Meanwhile, Tyrion Lannister awkwardly tries to entertain Grey Worm and Missandei while waiting for Varys. Varys arrives and explains that he has discovered that the slave masters of Yunkai, Astapor, and Volantis have been financing the Sons of the Harpy. Grey Worm notes that the Unsullied have taken Astapor and Yunkai once before, but Tyrion warns him that marching on the cities will leave Meereen defenseless. They come to the conclusion that the only way to defeat the Sons of the Harpy is to hunt them down. Tyrion asks Varys to send his "little birds"  to deliver a message to the leaders of Astapor, Yunkai, and Volantis.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>Qyburn gives orders to the "little birds" that he has inherited from Varys as Cersei, Jaime Lannister, and the re-animated Ser Gregor Clegane arrive.

In between sessions, the Waif questions Arya about who she used to be. Arya reveals all of her family members and reveals that she had taken the Hound off her kill list before she left him to die.

Arya drinks and closes her eyes, reopening them to reveal that her sight has been restored.<br><br>At Winterfell<br><br>Smalljon Umber meets with Ramsay Bolton and Harald Karstark. He explains to Ramsay that Jon Snow has been letting Wildlings through the Wall and fears that they will make their way south. When Ramsay asks why the Umbers have not already sworn fealty, Smalljon expresses his dislike for Roose Bolton and declares that was why Ramsay killed him, despite Ramsay's false insistence that Roose was poisoned. Ramsay offers assistance if Smalljon will swear to him as Warden of the North but he refuses, citing Roose's betrayal of his oath to Robb Stark. Instead, Smalljon demonstrates his loyalty by presenting Ramsay with "a gift", two hooded figures who are revealed to be Rickon Stark and Osha. When Ramsay asks him how he can be sure that the boy is Rickon Stark, Smalljon presents him with the severed head of Rickon's direwolf Shaggydog.<br><br>At the Wall<br><br>After awakening, Jon Snow is greeted by Davos Seaworth and Melisandre. When asked by Davos what he can remember, Jon says he remembers only his assassination but nothing from being dead. Melisandre tells Jon that her religion prophesies the return of a heroic prince and suggests that this prince may not be Stannis, as she first thought, but Jon. Jon enters the courtyard to meet with the wildlings. He meets with and embraces Tormund Giantsbane and Dolorous Edd, Tormund saying the Wildlings think he is a god.<br><br>Jon presides over the hanging of Ser Alliser Thorne, Olly, Othell Yarwyck, and Bowen Marsh. He takes last words from all those who are about to be executed except from Olly who remains silent. Ser Alliser is unrepentant, declaring only that he did what was right for the Night's Watch, and while he will now be able to rest, Jon will still be fighting the wildlings' battles forever. Jon cuts the rope and the mutineers' necks break. Jon then gives his cloak to Edd, telling him that Castle Black is now his and saying "My watch is ended".</p></div></div>

After telling each other their stories, Sansa tries to convince Jon to help her retake Winterfell. However, Jon is still reluctant to fight. Frustrated, Sansa declares to Jon that she will take back Winterfell whether he helps her or not.<br><br>Meanwhile, Brienne confronts Davos Seaworth and Melisandre, and informs them that she killed Stannis after he admitted to using dark magic to assassinate Renly. She warns Davos and Melisandre that even though that was in the past, she does not forget or forgive.<br><br>Some time later, a letter from Ramsay to Jon arrives. Ramsay boasts that he has Rickon in his custody. He demands Sansa's return, threatening to have the Bolton army exterminate the wildlings, kill Rickon and gang-rape Sansa while forcing Jon to watch before they kill him. Angered, Sansa decides to fight to take back Winterfell from the Boltons, and Jon agrees.

When Lord of Runestone Yohn Royce asks how Sansa became married to Ramsay Bolton instead of at the Fingers, Littlefinger claims Bolton's men attacked them and kidnapped her on the way. When Royce is dubious, Littlefinger adds that he was the only person who knew of their destination, implying his guilt. He manipulates Arryn into considering executing Royce, then into giving him a second chance after he pledges his absolute loyalty. Littlefinger then tells Arryn that Sansa, his cousin, has escaped the Boltons and is taking refuge at Castle Black, but that she is still not safe. Arryn agrees to command Royce to lead the knights of the Vale to protect her.<br><br>In Meereen<br><br>Despite Grey Worm and Missandei's objections, Tyrion Lannister arranges a diplomatic meeting with the masters of Astapor, Yunkai and Volantis.

He then takes Margaery to see Loras, who is breaking under the Sparrows' torture, and is willing to do anything to make it stop. Margaery realises that the High Sparrow is trying to use Loras to break her, and tells him to remain strong.<br><br>Cersei Lannister meets with Tommen Baratheon, who brings up the High Sparrow. Tommen is reluctant to provoke him, but Cersei says he is dangerous because he has no respect for the Crown. Tommen tells Cersei that Margaery's walk of atonement will happen soon. Cersei relays the information to Kevan Lannister and Olenna Tyrell in the Small Council chamber. Tyrell is horrified and pledges her army to defeat the Sparrows.

The High Sparrow declares that Margaery will not have to perform a walk of atonement, and instead presents King Tommen, who has agreed to unite the Faith and the Crown. When Mace Tyrell asks his mother, Lady Olenna what this means, she bitterly replies it means the High Sparrow has won.<br><br>In the throne room, King Tommen relieves Jaime of his duties on the Kingsguard as punishment for taking up arms against the Faith, to Jaime's dismay. While speaking with Cersei, Jaime reveals that he has been given orders to oust the Blackfish from Riverrun, but that he would rather massacre the Faith Militant to release Tommen from the High Sparrow's influence. Cersei warns him that, if he does so, he will be killed, thus defeating the purpose of liberating Tommen. She counsels him to instead lead the Lannister army on Riverrun, as a show of force to their enemies. About her upcoming trial, Cersei expresses no concern, saying it will be a trial by combat and with "the Mountain" as her champion, she has no fear of a guilty verdict. Cersei and Jaime then passionately kiss and presumably begin making love.<br><br>At the Twins<br><br>Lord Walder Frey receives word that Riverrun has been retaken by Brynden Tully, commonly known as the Blackfish, Catelyn Stark's uncle and a staunchly loyal officer in Robb Stark's army. Walder chastises his sons Lothar Frey and Black Walder Rivers, who had been ordered to hold the castle. They defend their loss, as several Riverlords, including House Mallister and House Blackwood, have risen in rebellion against the Freys, and the Brotherhood Without Banners are raiding their supply lines and camps. Walder demands that the Tully stronghold be taken back, refusing to be humiliated by not being able to hold a single castle. He orders his men to bring in Edmure Tully, held as a prisoner of the Freys since the Red Wedding, and declares that they will use him to retake Riverrun.<br><br>In the Dothraki Sea<br><br>Daenerys discusses with Daario how many ships she will need to cross the Narrow Sea with the Dothraki, the Unsullied and the Second Sons; Daario estimates that at least 1,000 ships will be needed for all of Daenerys's army. Seeing a suspicious gust of wind, Daenerys rides out alone. As Daario prepares to follow her, Drogon flies over the khalasar, with Daenerys riding on his back. Daenerys proceeds to rally the Dothraki by stating that she chooses them all to be her bloodriders, rather than the traditional three chosen by Khals. She then asks if they will cross the sea with her and help her retake the Seven Kingdoms, which they unanimously agree to do.</p></div></div>

First, they secure the allegiance of the Wildlings, who are still indebted to Jon for saving them at Hardhome, and are aware the Boltons will wipe them out if they do nothing. They also manage to secure the allegiance of House Mormont when Davos warns the young Lady Lyanna Mormont of the dangers the White Walkers pose. However, they are unable to secure the allegiance of House Glover, with Lord Robett Glover pointing out how Robb Stark failed to protect his home from the Ironborn.<br><br>In the end, Jon and Sansa are only able to recruit a small number of minor houses, only adding a few hundred extra soldiers to their army. Despite being heavily outnumbered, Jon is adamant that they attack Winterfell as soon as possible before the Boltons rally more forces and before the weather turns on them. Sansa disagrees, insisting that they try and recruit more houses. When Jon refuses to change his mind, Sansa begins writing a letter to be sent by raven.<br><br>In King's Landing<br><br>The High Sparrow chides Queen Margaery Tyrell that she needs to provide King Tommen Baratheon with an heir, and that she should try to convert her grandmother Olenna to the Faith, subtly remarking that Olenna's safety cannot be guaranteed otherwise. Margaery meets with Olenna, who attempts to convince her to leave King's Landing and return to Highgarden. Margaery refuses, stating that as Queen, her place is supposed to be at King Tommen's side. Margaery discreetly slips her a piece of paper with the sigil of House Tyrell drawn on it, indicating that she is still loyal to her family, upon which Olenna agrees to leave. Cersei Lannister then confronts Olenna, and tries to convince her to stay and fight the Sparrows. Olenna points out that they have already lost and blames the Sparrows' rise to power on Cersei's lack of foresight. Despite having no allies in King's Landing, Cersei decides to stay and fight.<br><br>In Volantis<br><br>Theon and Yara Greyjoy take the Iron Fleet to Volantis to take on supplies. Yara, who is enjoying a female Volantene prostitute, tries to encourage Theon to regain his former identity and confidence, as she will need his assistance in retaking the Iron Islands.

However, she is subsequently attacked on a nearby bridge and repeatedly stabbed in the abdomen by the Waif, in the guise of an elderly woman.

After surfacing, she is then left stumbling through the streets, critically wounded.<br><br>In the Riverlands<br><br>Jaime Lannister and Bronn lead the Lannister army to Riverrun, where Lothar Frey and Walder Rivers attempt to coerce the Blackfish into surrendering the castle by threatening to execute Edmure Tully. The Blackfish calls their bluff and refuses to surrender. Disgusted with the Freys' incompetence, Jaime takes charge of the siege, orders Edmure to be bathed and fed, and attempts to parley with the Blackfish, warning him that the Lannisters will show no mercy to the Tullys if they do not surrender the castle. The Blackfish is not intimidated by Jaime's threats and dares him to try and seize the castle, declaring that the Tullys have enough provisions stockpiled to outlast a Lannister siege.<br><br>Sandor Clegane, otherwise known as the Hound, is revealed to have survived his wounds, and is now living among a small band of villagers. Their leader, a warrior turned septon named Ray, talks with Sandor, and recounts how he found Sandor on the verge of death and nursed him back to health. However, Sandor still feels guilt over his past sins, feeling he has not been punished for them. At a gathering, a trio of men from the Brotherhood Without Banners arrives and attempts to extort the villagers, but upon finding out that they have no worthwhile possessions, they leave. Sandor warns Ray that the Brotherhood will return, but Ray refuses to prepare for a confrontation with them. After Sandor goes out to the forest to gather some wood, he returns to find the villagers slaughtered and Ray hanged. Enraged, Sandor picks up an axe and marches off.</p></div></div>

Sandor bargains with Beric, who allows him to personally hang two of the men. Beric and Thoros try to recruit Sandor into the Brotherhood, explaining that they intend to head north to fight the White Walkers and need his strength.<br><br>Brienne of Tarth and Podrick Payne arrive at Riverrun, where they reunite with Jaime Lannister and Bronn. Brienne explains that she has come to recruit the Blackfish and the Tully army for Sansa, but Jaime points out that he is currently besieged in Riverrun and refuses to surrender the castle. Brienne proposes that if she can convince the Blackfish to surrender the castle, then Jaime will allow him and the Tully army safe passage to the North. Jaime agrees to the plan, but gives Brienne until nightfall. She then returns Oathkeeper to Jaime, stating that she has completed her mission. Jaime, however, tells her that she can keep it, as Oathkeeper is hers and hers alone. Brienne then attempts to negotiate with the Blackfish, but he refuses to abandon Riverrun, despite being sympathetic to Sansa's plight.<br><br>Meanwhile, Jaime talks with Edmure Tully, trying to win his cooperation by tempting him with seeing his newborn son, whom he has never seen, and offering to send him and his family to Casterly Rock, away from the Freys. Edmure ridicules Jaime and all of his past misdeeds, and asks him how he can live with himself. Jaime responds how he wants to take Riverrun to be back with Cersei, and he is willing to do anything to achieve it, even if it means killing every Tully he finds, including Edmure and his son. Jaime then sends Edmure to parley with the Blackfish. Despite the Blackfish's protests, the Tully soldiers allow Edmure entry into the castle. Edmure then orders his men to surrender Riverrun, and also orders the Blackfish's capture. The Blackfish helps Brienne and Podrick escape, but stays behind to fight to the end.<br><br>Jaime is informed about the death of the Blackfish, and sees Brienne and Pod escaping on the river.

He then tries to introduce them to humor by trading jokes. As they start having a good time, they are interrupted when a fleet which was sent by the masters arrives to attack the city, with Missandei explaining that they have come to recover their "property".

Cersei refuses to go with them and when one of the Faith Militant attacks, he is brutally killed by Gregor Clegane. Seeing the rest of the Faith Militant soldiers intimidated, Cersei remarks that the High Sparrow is free to come to the Red Keep to see her. She then attends a royal announcement by Tommen in the throne room, but is denied standing by his side by Kevan Lannister, her uncle and Hand of the King. Tommen then announces the date that Cersei and Loras' trials will be held, and that, in consultation with the High Sparrow, he has decided to end the practice of trial by combat as a means of resolving conflicts. The prospect of a trial by seven septons clearly worries Cersei. Qyburn then reports to Cersei about the "rumor" that she ordered him to investigate, and he remarks that it is "more, much more".<br><br>In Braavos<br><br>Lady Crane returns to her chambers to find a wounded Arya Stark hiding inside, and helps stitch her wounds. She tells Arya that thanks to her warning, she mutilated her would-be killer Bianca's face before kicking her out of the acting company. She then offers to have Arya join them, but she refuses, saying that she intends to travel west of Westeros to see the edge of the world. As Arya recovers, The Waif arrives and kills Lady Crane, intending to kill Arya as well. Arya flees through the streets of Braavos, but during the chase, Arya's wounds reopen and she limps back to her hideout with the Waif in close pursuit. As the Waif closes in, Arya uses Needle to cut a candle, plunging the room into total darkness, where, having been trained while blinded for several weeks, Arya gains the upper hand.<br><br>At the House of Black and White, Jaqen H'ghar finds a bloodtrail and follows it to the Hall of Faces, where he finds the Waif's face. Arya then holds Jaqen at sword point. Jaqen congratulates Arya by telling her that she is finally No One. However, she rejects the title, asserting her identity as Arya Stark before turning and leaving, announcing that she is "going home." Jaqen proudly watches on as she leaves.</p></div></div>

She counters that the meeting was called to discuss the Masters' surrender and rides Drogon into the bay with Rhaegal and Viserion and burns the fleet. Missandei tells the Masters that Daenerys has ordered one of them to die as punishment for their crimes. Although they offer the lowborn Yezzan, Grey Worm kills the other two masters instead and Tyrion tells Yezzan to warn the other masters of Daenerys's power.

Ramsay offers to pardon Jon for breaking his Night's Watch vows if he hands Sansa over. Jon offers to settle their dispute with single combat; Ramsay refuses, saying that he may be unable to defeat Jon but the Bolton army can beat the Stark loyalists.

Ramsay gloats that he has been starving his hounds in anticipation of feeding them Jon and his advisers.<br><br>After Jon discusses the battle plan with Tormund and Davos, Sansa criticizes him for attacking without gathering more men and predicts that Ramsay will defeat them. Jon insists that the army is the largest one possible. When Jon asks Melisandre not to resurrect him if he dies in battle, she says that it is up to the Lord of Light. Davos and Tormund discuss their time serving Stannis and Mance and acknowledge that they may have served the wrong king all along.

Ramsay brings Rickon out and has him run to Jon while firing arrows at him. Jon rushes to intercept Rickon but just before escaping, Rickon is killed by an arrow. Jon charges at Ramsay, who orders the Bolton archers to fire and his cavalry to charge; Davos orders the Stark force to shield Jon. The battle leaves hundreds of Bolton and Stark soldiers dead from hand-to-hand combat and from Bolton arrows, creating a wall of corpses. The Bolton infantry forms a circle around the Stark forces. Although the giant Wun Wun kills some Bolton soldiers, Tormund panics and sends the Wildlings towards the wall of bodies and Smalljon's forces, who easily cut them down. Jon is trampled by the Wildlings but struggles to his feet. The Stark forces appear doomed when a horn sounds in the distance as Petyr Baelish and Sansa arrive with the Knights of the Vale, who smash the Bolton army; Tormund kills Smalljon in the chaos.<br><br>Ramsay retreats to Winterfell, followed by Jon, Wun Wun and Tormund. Wun Wun breaks down Winterfell's gates and the Stark loyalists overwhelm the remnants of the Bolton garrison. A mortally wounded Wun Wun is finished off by Ramsay, who tells Jon that he has reconsidered the offer of single combat. Jon blocks Ramsay's arrows with a shield, overpowers and attempts to beat Ramsay to death, stopping when he sees Sansa and ordering him imprisoned, leaving Winterfell once more in the hands of House Stark. Bolton banners are shown falling off the walls and battlements of Winterfell to be replaced by the Stark direwolf. Sansa visits Ramsay after he is placed in the kennels with his hounds and despite Ramsay's insistence that his hounds will not turn on him, they devour him face-first as Sansa walks away, smiling.</p></div></div>
