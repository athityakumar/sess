Neal's father James explains how as a young cop he began working for a gangster named Dennis Flynn, now deceased.  When he tried to end his employment Flynn framed him for the murder of his superior, and he confessed when some unknown person with high law enforcement connections threatened his wife, Neal, and Ellen.  Believing him guilty, Neal's mother refused further contact.  In the present, Neal and Peter infiltrate the operations of Flynn's son, also named Dennis.  They pose as the maker and potential buyer, respectively, of counterfeit whisky, and are able to prove that the younger Dennis killed Ellen.  But Dennis is killed in custody, showing that the law enforcement conspiracy is still in operation.  James is sent to a safe house while Neal and Peter plan their next move.</p></div></div>

They plan to bring him down by proving fraud charges against his associate, land developer Cole Edwards (Reed Diamond).  But Edwards remains loyal to the Senator, who retaliates by ending the FBI career of Peter's boss.  Meanwhile Mozzie is paired up with Jones to search for the meaning of a key left to Neal in Ellen's personal effects.

Neal concocts an elaborate plan to get the evidence box out of the Empire State Building even though Pratt and Calloway are also searching for it.  Pratt's man stops an escaping James, who is carrying what he thinks is the box but is actually a decoy given to him by Mozzie.  In the ensuing confrontation, James kills Pratt with Peter's gun and escapes, leaving Peter to be arrested for the murder with all the physical evidence against him.  Neal learns from the real evidence box that James was actually guilty of the murder for which he was imprisoned. Neal begs James to go to the FBI and tell the truth to free Peter, but James coldly refuses and leaves Neal with the realization that his father used him.</p></div></div>

Peter is about to be prosecuted for murder, which could end his FBI career even if he were acquitted. Elizabeth urges Neal to save him at any cost. Neal is contacted by the Dutchman, Curtis Hagan (Mark Sheppard), the man he helped Peter convict of forgery in their first case together. Hagan has influence over Peter's prosecutor, and can get the charges dismissed if Neal can make a convincing fake audio confession from James. Neal and Mozzie do this and learn Hagan's price: Neal must steal a collection of gold coins from a secure building. Neal does this with the aid of a device Mozzie has built to spoof the anklet's signal to make him appear to be at home. Neal then learns that the Dutchman has filmed the heist and plans to blackmail him into committing further crimes for him. Peter is promoted to be head of the NYC White Collar Crime office. He gives Neal a new anklet and promises him a new handler from outside the office. Their last case together is to investigate the coin robbery.</p></div></div>

The FBI have arrested the proprietor of a website for stolen goods, and they plan to arrest his contacts while a very pregnant Diana works hard to make the website appear to continue operating. Neal and Siegel are sent to the warehouse of an art dealer involved with the website, who turns out to be Mozzie. He escapes, but Siegel sees him; though Neal is able to keep Peter from learning that the dealer is Mozzie, Siegel uncovers the "Teddy" identity behind Mozzie's vast holdings. This is actually what Mozzie believes to be his true identity, that of a baby who disappeared shortly before Mozzie was found.  Mozzie returns to the warehouse, sets fire to it, and vanishes into a hideout beneath it.  The FBI believe Teddy is dead, but Diana is not fooled, goes to the warehouse, and finds the hideout.  She tries to arrest Mozzie but suddenly goes into labor. Mozzie delivers the baby, whom she names "Theo", and she so far keeps his secret.

Hagan is free, and he gives Neal 48 hours to steal one chapter of a mysterious book on display at a museum.  Neal and Mozzie plan to fool another criminal, Zev, into breaking into the museum to steal a painting, with Neal taking the book chapter at the same time and then catching Zev. To get access, he befriends a museum worker named Rebecca (Bridget Regan) and steals her key. Neal tells Siegel he has heard chatter indicating that the museum is about to be robbed, and Peter authorizes a stakeout. Mozzie disables the security cameras of the museum and Zev enters.  Neal is delayed when Peter, nostalgic about his former partnership, joins the stakeout. However, he is able to enter the building and replace the chapter with a forgery Mozzie has created. Zev trips the alarms but still escapes; Neal leaves prints behind when he escapes himself. Neal and Peter find Zev's prints at the crime scene, allowing the FBI to arrest Zev and recover the painting.  Neal gives the book chapter to Hagan after making a copy; he and Mozzie will try to figure out why Hagan wanted it. Siegel secretly witnesses the meeting between Neal and Hagan. Rebecca is fired for the security breach, after learning that Neal works with the FBI.  Siegel is found murdered on the street.</p></div></div>

The now-destitute Mozzie has moved into Neal's apartment.  With the investigation of Siegel's death stalled, Peter joins Neal for a new field assignment.  A disoriented man named Nate Griffith (David Call) walks into the Bureau, carrying a packet of cash, confessing that he broke into a vault and stole $2 million. Peter and Neal trace Griffith to Dr. Mara Summers, his psychiatrist. Peter decides to examine the vault with Neal. The bank claims ignorance of any break-in. Neal checks their records for details on the vault, and traces it back to "Niteowl Holdings". Peter and Neal suspect Dr. Summers has something to do with the robbery. Peter traces Niteowl Holdings to Shane Jacobi, an ex-con, and confronts him. He denies any connection to Niteowl Holdings, but appears surprised to learn that the vault was robbed. Meanwhile, Neal approaches Dr. Summers as a patient, hoping to glean some information from her. But she drugs him, and gets information on the ongoing investigation from him. Moz identifies the drug as "Good Night Cinderella", used by Asian prostitutes to rob their johns.  He suggests that the best way to recall what he told Dr. Summers would be to go back under the drug again. Moz makes the drug, Neal drinks it, and Peter and Moz help Neal recall the entire conversation. The next day, Peter and Jones visit Griffith's house, and on discovering Jacobi there, they arrest him. They realize that Summers manipulated Griffith into robbing Jacobi's vault. Neal gets a confession from Dr. Summers by putting her under the drug. The FBI arrest Dr. Summers but do not recover the money, because Neal has diverted it and given it to Mozzie to start afresh. He tells Mozzie that he plans to free himself from all constraints, including both Hagan's and Peter's.</p></div></div>

Peter's anniversary dinner with Elizabeth is interrupted by an attractive woman named Jill (Kim Dickens), his ex-girlfriend and former classmate at the FBI academy. Jill now works for a secretive division of the FBI and wants Peter's help in buying a computer chip, potentially of great use to enemy nations, from a hacker now living in Manhattan.  Jill insists that no one else know anything about the mission, which makes Elizabeth suspicious and later interferes with Peter's efforts to conduct the buy safely.  Peter and Jill notice and identify two mercenaries that are also following the hacker, but when they go to the hotel room for the buy, they are unaware that the mercenaries have evaded Jones' surveillance.  Elizabeth and Neal come to the same hotel at the same time, suspecting Jill's intentions toward Peter.  When the mercenaries capture everyone, only Elizabeth and Neal's initiative saves the day.  Meanwhile, Neal and Jones recover Siegel's gun and FBI badge; though the petty criminal who was using them in carjackings appears to be a dead end, but Peter finds a possible clue in the badge.  Also, Neal and Rebecca are able to decipher a picture of a stained glass window from the book chapter, and Rebecca believes the window might be in New York, where Mosconi briefly lived in 1886.  Later, he is able to show her the  window, and they kiss.</p></div></div>

He and Neal foil a thief's attempt to steal the egg back; he identifies a financier (Željko Ivanek) as his employer but does not know where the skeleton is.

Meanwhile, a suspicious Peter discovers that Neal is seeing Rebecca, and when he and Elizabeth crash their romantic dinner he learns that Rebecca thinks Neal is an FBI agent.  Neal tells him he lied to her so she would not know of his criminal past, and Peter urges him to come clean to her.  He does so and Rebecca accepts him; they have sex.  Hagan correctly deduces that Neal plans to steal the stained-glass window, and with an implicit threat to June he tells Neal to steal it for him.</p></div></div>

In bed, Neal tells Rebecca a limited version of the truth but says he can't involve her in the theft of the window for her own safety.  She convinces him to let her help, and the next day she distracts the men repairing the window while Neal and Mozzie steal it.  They discover that one of the panels allows secret messages in Chapter 13 to be read, but only in the real Chapter 13, not their copy.  They plan to trade this panel to Hagan for the evidence that Hagan has of Neal's earlier coin theft.  At the same time, an FBI watch of pawnshops turns up one of the gold coins that Neal stole for Hagan, and that Hagan used to bribe Peter's prosecutor Dawson.  Peter's investigation leads him to Decker, the man who fenced them for Dawson, but Mozzie tips off Decker and allows him to escape.  Peter goes to Neal's apartment and claims that he has captured Decker, and Neal confesses to the coin theft, implying that he rather than Hagan was the one who bribed Dawson to save Peter.  Peter feels obligated to arrest Neal and thus reopen his own case, probably ending his career, but Elizabeth counsels him against this.  The next morning, Jones actually arrests Decker, and Peter does not question him about the coins; there are enough weapons and other contraband coins in Decker's store to ensure his conviction on other charges. Peter then goes to Dawson and offers not to reveal the bribe if Dawson resigns his position and returns the coins, which he does.  Peter tells Neal that there will be "changes" in their working relationship, as he now realizes that Neal cannot fully change his criminal ways. Neal agrees.</p></div></div>

Peter is offered a promotion and reassignment to DC, but he is reluctant to take it until he resolves the mystery of Siegel's murder.  Neal brings the panel to a meeting with Hagan intending to bargain, but Hagan shows him that he is holding Rebecca hostage and forces him and Mozzie to solve the puzzle hidden in the Codex.  Peter is called to investigate an apparent forgery of a painting by William Blake.  He calls in Neal despite the tension between them, and Neal finds Hagan's hidden signature in the painting.  By offering to buy the painting and then tracking the resulting computer activity, Peter finds the seller's location, which is the very building where Neal and Mozzie are working with Hagan.  Neal forces Hagan to release Rebecca by threatening to destroy the Codex chapter, then does it anyway after Mozzie has memorized their results.  He finds Rebecca on a Brooklyn street and they embrace; Rebecca tells Neal that the hidden treasure is a twin to the Hope Diamond.  The FBI arrive at that building and arrest Hagan, who says he has information that Peter should consider if he values his freedom. They go to Hagan's house to look at it, but Hagan is killed by a sniper before he can reveal anything.  On Hagan's body is information that leads Neal and Peter to a Brooklyn apartment, which both Hagan and Siegel were watching on the day Siegel died.  They enter the apartment and find three things: extensive files on Neal, Peter, and their associates, preparations to make both the Blake forgery and Hagan's signature, and evidence that the apartment's occupant is actually Rebecca.</p></div></div>

While Neal distracts Rebecca, the FBI search her apartment.  Peter concludes that she is actually in love with Neal, and as a ruse calls her in and tells her that Neal is the prime suspect in Hagan's murder.  She asks Neal to meet in a park; Neal tells her he will have to run and she offers to go with him.  Just as she is about to say that she is not really a mild-mannered book expert, she detects the FBI stakeout and flees.  From evidence in the apartment, Peter determines that she is really Rachel Turner, a disgraced former MI5 agent.  He also figures out where she hid the gun with which she killed Siegel.  Against Peter's instructions, Neal arranges another meeting with her, offering to trade the location of the diamond for Hagan's blackmail information.  Once he has the information he handcuffs her and tells her the FBI are on the way.  She shoots the handcuff instead of him but she has been delayed long enough for the FBI to catch her.  With Siegel's murder solved, Peter and Elizabeth prepare to move to Washington, where he has accepted the FBI promotion and she has accepted a job with the National Gallery.  Neal and Mozzie are preparing to use Mozzie's memorized information to find the diamond when "Rebecca" phones from prison to say she will see Neal soon.</p></div></div>

Neal asks Peter to support his request to have his sentence set aside, assuring him that he can truly go straight.  As they are packing up evidence from Rebecca's case, a phone rings with a request to hire Rebecca for a job.  Peter asks Diana to impersonate Rebecca and meet with the client.  Rebecca is brought to the FBI office, where she helps Diana authenticate herself in return for being allowed to talk to Neal.  The client wants Rebecca to steal a thumb drive from a financier's office, and Jones deduces that the drive contains an algorithm that could cause a financial crash.  The financier takes the drive to his house, and while Peter is still applying for a warrant, Diana and Neal plan to break in and steal it.  When Diana is called away for a child-care emergency, Neal does so; the emergency is revealed to have been the work of Mozzie, who has driven away her son Theo's nanny, forcing Diana to have Mozzie care for his namesake during the case.  Diana gives a fake drive to the client, who incriminates himself and is arrested, with a slight hitch when the real Rebecca texts him that she is in custody.  Theo inspires Mozzie to a breakthrough on the Mosconi puzzle, but as he calls Neal to tell him about it, he is shown being watched by Rebecca, who has escaped from prison.</p></div></div>

Peter and Neal find Mozzie, who has been injected with something.  Rebecca then tells them she has poisoned him and will trade the antidote for the diamond.  Interpreting Mozzie's symbols as geographical coordinates leads them to Fort Totten in Queens, where Mozzie is able to guide them near the diamond's location before collapsing.  Mozzie is hospitalized and successfully treated for belladonna poisoning after Jones and Diana determine where Rebecca got her poison.  Peter and Neal find the diamond and call Rebecca, who has been following them and immediately takes them prisoner at gunpoint.  She locks them in a cell and prepares to leave by helicopter, but they escape and Neal reveals that he switched the diamond with a similar-sized piece of brick before giving it to her.  He convinces her to surrender rather than shoot him.  Peter asks the FBI for Neal's release and believes they will agree; Neal tells Mozzie he plans to go straight.  But the FBI director refuses to sign off – perhaps, Peter speculates, because Neal is so useful to them.  Disillusioned, Peter tells Elizabeth he wants to stay in his current position closer to field work; she agrees but wants to keep the job in DC.  A bitter Neal asks Mozzie to circumvent the new anklet.  After Mozzie leaves, Neal recognizes and confronts a man who has been following him.  He is then grabbed from behind and thrown in a van, without his anklet.</p></div></div>

Peter brings Rebecca in to help locate Neal, who is being held captive by one of her former associates, Jim Boothe. Meanwhile, Jim wastes no time letting Neal know that if he doesn't comply with his demands he'll be pushed down an elevator shaft. Jim has lofty aspirations of joining an exclusive group of thieves, The Pink Panthers, and his entry ticket is the diamond currently held by the FBI. He needs Neal to steal it back. But Neal has a better plan - he thinks the situation calls for a grander gesture, and, for his trouble, he expects something in return. Elizabeth tells Peter that she is pregnant. Rebecca, upon leaving white collar, takes an agent's gun which leaves the second agent no choice but to shoot her, killing her in the end. As Neal says, "She made a choice. For Her, it was better to risk almost certain death than go back to jail."</p></div></div>

The U.S. Attorney General signs off on a contract, written by Mozzie, guaranteeing Neal's freedom if he helps take down the Panthers.  Neal goes to his first meeting with them, without his anklet, and is surprised to meet Keller, who according to Russian authorities is still in one of their prisons.  The Panthers assign Neal to steal a stamp about to be auctioned by an Argentine woman.  Neal and Peter obtain admission to the auction by posing as a reclusive father and son, and Neal successfully takes the stamp in spite of a sophisticated security system.  But the FBI will not release the stamp, so Neal makes a forgery which Keller vouches for.  Neal deduces that Keller is an undercover Interpol informant, and confirms this with him, agreeing that neither can afford to expose the other.  The Panthers tell Neal that the purpose of his theft of the stamp was to test the security system in preparation for a bigger job.  Mozzie deduces that Elizabeth is pregnant, and Peter later tells Neal.</p></div></div>

The Panthers assign Keller and Neal to copy a data disk from a safe in a security firm's office.  Neal cultivates Amy, the assistant to the firm's head, and gets Mozzie into the safe, but the disk uses 1970's technology and Mozzie must take it home to read it.  Before they can get it back to the safe, Amy's boss returns early from a trip and discovers it missing.  Neal suggests that Amy confess to taking it to expose the security weakness, then ask for a promotion.  Instead she quits her job in disgust and Neal is broken-hearted at having betrayed her.  Keller and his Interpol handler Luc give the disk to the Panthers, and the FBI are able to interpret it as instructions to route some high-value cargo randomly through US airports.</p></div></div>

Five years ago, while Neal was in prison, Mozzie met, worked with, and married a con artist named Eva before she swindled and abandoned him.  Now Eva is back, asking for a divorce so she can marry Jack, a wealthy man who has recently devoted his life to charity.  Neal and Peter determine that Eva and Jack are working together and plan to steal a Faberge egg, leaving Mozzie as the fall guy.  They stop the theft, but Mozzie allows Eva to escape, without signing the divorce papers.  Meanwhile, the FBI figure out that the Panthers' target is a plane bringing hundreds of millions in cash back from Europe, to a random airport determined by the stolen algorithm.  Peter has the San Francisco FBI stake out the latest plane, but the Panthers don't show because, as Woodford tells Neal at June's house, they know that they have a mole.</p></div></div>

Woodford does not know who the mole is, but he is sure it is not Neal since a spy bug was found before Neal joined the group. Neal refuses to help find the mole, making Woodford trust him even more and reveal the plan to steal the cash from the airport via a massive armed assault.  Peter finds that the spy bug was planted by Luc to spy on Keller, and he asks Luc to pull Keller off of the operation.  Peter, Mozzie and Neal brainstorm ways the Panthers could steal the cash less dangerously, until Peter hits on the idea of using pneumatic tubes built decades ago to move mail out of the airport. Luc finds out Neal is hiding something and decides to disobey Peter and leave Keller on the operation. Keller kills Luc and puts his own tracking chip on Woodford's deputy, who is then killed by Woodford. The FBI and Interpol agree to keep the operation going so Luc's death won't be in vain. Peter misses the appointment with Elizabeth to view the first sonogram of their son, and vows to her that he will never let anything else be a priority. Mozzie begs Neal to be introduced to the Pink Panthers, but Neal refuses, telling him it's not the right time. Since the Panthers are now one man short, Neal brings Peter to the meeting stating he's the one who's been helping him. Woodford responds by aiming his gun at Peter.</p></div></div>

The Panthers' plan proceeds as planned except for two things: Mozzie intercepts a portion of the cash by opening the pneumatic tube in a tunnel, and the FBI arrests everyone at the end. Neal and Keller sneak away from Peter and meet Mozzie in the tunnel, where Keller betrays their arrangement and apparently shoots Neal in a struggle. Peter arrives, kills the fleeing Keller, and finds Neal being taken away in an ambulance. At the hospital, he and Mozzie view what appears to be Neal's lifeless body. One year later, Peter and El are raising their infant son Neal when a mysterious delivery of a bottle of fine wine inspires Peter to search out a storage unit containing evidence that the original Neal faked his death. Peter smiles and laughs as he concludes this, and Neal Caffrey is last seen in Paris, seeking out some new adventure.</p></div></div>
