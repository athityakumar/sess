Gordon meets the Waynes' son, Bruce, and promises the boy that he will find the killer. Their investigation leads them to a parolee named Mario Pepper, whom Bullock shoots when he flees and attacks Gordon. They discover that Pepper had been framed, leading them to mobster Fish Mooney, an associate of Don Carmine Falcone. Mooney has them captured, but Falcone spares them upon his arrival. In exchange, Falcone orders Gordon to kill Oswald Cobblepot, a low-level member of Mooney's gang and informant for Gotham MCU investigators Renee Montoya and Crispus Allen. Gordon fakes Cobblepot's death, and tells him never to return to Gotham. Gordon and Bullock are celebrated for solving the Wayne murders, but Gordon confesses the truth to Bruce and his butler, Alfred Pennyworth. As Gordon leaves, Selina is seen lingering around the borders of Wayne Manor.</p></div></div>

The Goat targets a girl named Shelley Lawson, which leads a younger Bullock and his partner Detective Dix (Dan Hedaya) to try and rescue her. When Lawson is found dead, they find the killer, Randall Milkie, who claims that "Randall Milkie is dead" as he tries to attack them. Milkie is shot down by Bullock after Dix falls through a trap door and ends up badly injured. Ten years later, Bullock finds Robert Hastings' daughter, Amanda, murdered by someone with the same "Goat" motive. Upon surgery, Harvey sees a penny inside her neck, Milkie's trademark, which only he and Dix knew, which meant that he was not an imposter. They find out that Hastings' psychotherapist Dr. Marks (Susan Misner) hypnotized both Milkie and the new killer to become the Goat to scare Gotham City's rich and corrupt. The "murder" of Cobblepot is also investigated, with Gordon the prime suspect as Montoya and Allen finally find a witness near the river. When they attempt to arrest Gordon and Bullock, Cobblepot enters the police station, causing friction between Bullock and Gordon.</p></div></div>

A drunken Bullock re-evaluates his choice for helping Gordon, and the two partners attempt to arrest the mayor and Falcone, but they give up when it is revealed that Falcone and hitman Victor Zsasz have Barbara, who had come back to try and negotiate with Falcone for Gordon. As Falcone later tends to his chickens, Cobblepot visits him, and Falcone tells him that everything is going as Cobblepot predicted. In a flashback to the night they had met Gordon, it is shown that Cobblepot and Falcone had formed a deal, in which Falcone would place Gordon in charge of killing Cobblepot, giving Cobblepot a chance at surviving, and in exchange, Cobblepot would forge an alliance with Maroni, snitching for Falcone. Cobblepot tells Falcone that Mooney and Nikolai are conspiring against him.</p></div></div>

                        <div class="ui message"><p>Jack Gruber and Aaron Danzig escape from Arkham Asylum and rampage through Gotham. James Gordon promises the Commissioner he will arrest Gruber within 24 hours. Edward Nygma learns Gruber is a former Mafia bank robber who was betrayed by Salvatore Maroni. Gordon and Bullock put Maroni under protective custody to use as bait to attract Gruber to the police station. Gruber and Danzig attack the station, but Gordon thwarts them by shorting out Gruber's electrical apparatus with water. Fish Mooney makes her move against Falcone by "abducting" Liza and extorting him into signing his crime family over to Mooney's gang. Falcone nearly goes through with the deal, but Cobblepot informs him that Liza is Mooney's mole. Falcone confronts Mooney, has his mercenaries take both her and Butch Gilzean prisoner, and strangles Liza to death. Cobblepot inherits Mooney's nightclub and what's left of her gang. For living up to his end of the deal, Gordon is reinstated as a detective.</p></div></div>

He finds himself unprepared for the dangers of the forest, but Alfred eventually joins him for the campout.

Jonathan is rushed to the hospital, but the serum has sent him into a state of constant terror, and he may never stop hallucinating his greatest fear: animated scarecrows.</p></div></div>

Barbara tracks down Gordon. Claiming to be cured of her insanity, she tries to reconcile with Gordon, but to no avail. With Barbara's unorthodox assistance, Gordon discovers that the person who contracted Patrick Malone to kill Thomas and Martha Wayne is known as "the Philosopher." Bruce and Alfred track a lead from Thomas Wayne's computer and find Karen Jennings, a former Blackgate inmate on whom experiments were performed at Pinewood Farms, a Wayne Enterprises facility, by the Philosopher. She offers to identify the Philosopher, but Victor Fries is sent to kill her. Following Jennings' death, Lucius does further research and discovers that Hugo Strange is the Philosopher. After many failed attempts, Strange finally succeeds in resurrecting someone from the dead: Theo Galavan.</p></div></div>

After, Gordon is in holding when the lights flicker and Azrael shows up, killing a few officers and making an unsuccessful attempt on Gordon's life.
